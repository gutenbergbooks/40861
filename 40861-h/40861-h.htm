      THE RECORDS OF THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONVENTION.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent">
      James Madison&#39;s contemporaries generally conceded that he was the
      leading statesman in the convention which framed the Constitution of the
      United States; but in addition to this he kept a record of the proceedings
      of the convention which outranks in importance all the other writings of
      the founders of the American Republic. He is thus identified, as no other
      man is, with the making of the Constitution and the correct interpretation
      of the intentions of the makers. His is the only continuous record of the
      proceedings of the convention. He took a seat immediately in front of the
      presiding officer, among the members, and took down every speech or motion
      as it was made, using abbreviations of his own and immediately afterwards
      transcribing his notes when he returned to his lodgings. A few motions
      only escaped him and of important speeches he omitted none. The
      proceedings were ordered to be kept secret, but his self-imposed task of
      reporter had the unofficial sanction of the convention. Alexander Hamilton
      corrected slightly Madison&#39;s report of his great speech and handed him
      his plan of government to copy. The same thing was done with Benjamin
      Franklin&#39;s speeches, which were written out by Franklin and read by
      his colleague Wilson, the fatigue of delivery being too great for the aged
      Franklin, and Madison also copied the Patterson <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="pageviii" id="pageviii"></a>[pg&nbsp;viii]</span> plan. Edmund
      Randolph wrote out for him his opening speech from his notes two years
      after the convention adjourned.<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a

      In the years after the convention Madison made a few alterations and
      additions in his journal, with the result that in parts there is much
      interlineation and erasure, but after patient study the meaning is always
      perfectly clear. Three different styles of Madison&#39;s own penmanship at
      different periods of his life appear in the journal, one being that of his
      old age within five years of his death. In this hand appears the following
      note at the end of the journal: "The few alterations and corrections made
      in the debates which are not in my handwriting were dictated by me and
      made in my presence by John C. Payne."<a name="FNanchor_2_2"
      id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The
      rare occasions where Payne&#39;s penmanship is distinguishable are
      indicated in the notes to this edition.

    <p class="indent">
      The importance attached by Madison to his record is shown by the terms of
      his will, dated April 15, 1835, fourteen months before his death:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="indent">
        "I give all my personal estate ornamental as well as useful, except as
        herein after otherwise given, to my dear Wife; and I also give to her
        all my manuscript papers, having entire confidence in her discreet and
        proper use of them, but subject to the qualification in the succeeding
        clause. Considering the peculiarity and magnitude of the occasion which
        produced the Convention at Philadelphia in 1787, the Characters who
        composed it, the Constitution which resulted from their deliberations,
        its effects during a trial of so many years on the prosperity of the
        people living under it, and the interest it has inspired among the
        friends of free Government, it is not an unreasonable inference that a
        careful and extended report of the proceedings and discussions of <span

        that body, which were with closed doors, by a member who was constant in
        his attendance, will be particularly gratifying to the people of the
        United States, and to all who take an interest in the progress of
        political science and the course of true liberty. It is my desire that
        the Report as made by me should be published under her authority and
        direction."<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a

      This desire was never consummated, for Mrs. Madison&#39;s friends advised
      her that she could not herself profitably undertake the publication of the
      work, and she accordingly offered it to the Government, by which it was
      bought for $30,000, by act of Congress, approved March 3, 1837. On July 9,
      1838, an act was approved authorizing the Joint Committee on the Library
      to cause the papers thus purchased to be published, and the Committee
      intrusted the superintendence of the work to Henry D. Gilpin, Solicitor of
      the Treasury. The duplicate copy of the journal which Mrs. Madison had
      delivered was, under authority of Congress, withdrawn from the State
      Department and placed in Mr. Gilpin&#39;s hands. In 1840 (Washington:
      Lantree &amp; O&#39;Sulivan), accordingly, appeared the three volumes, <i>The
      Papers of James Madison Purchased by Order of Congress</i>, edited by
      Henry D. Gilpin. Other issues of this edition, with changes of date, came
      out later in New York, Boston, and Mobile. This issue contained not only
      the journal of the Constitutional Convention, but Madison&#39;s notes of
      the debates in the Continental Congress and in the Congress of the
      Confederation from February 19 to April 25, 1787, and a report Jefferson
      had written of the debates in 1776 on the Declaration of Independence,
      besides a number of letters of Madison&#39;s. From the text of Gilpin a
      fifth volume was added to Elliot&#39;s <i>Debates</i> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="pagex" id="pagex"></a>[pg&nbsp;x]</span> in 1845, and it was printed
      in one volume in Chicago, 1893.

    <p class="indent">
      Mr. Gilpin&#39;s reading of the duplicate copy of the Madison journal is
      thus the only one that has hitherto been published.<a name="FNanchor_4_4"
      id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> His
      work was both painstaking and thorough, but many inaccuracies and
      omissions have been revealed by a second reading from the original
      manuscript journal written in Madison&#39;s own hand, just as he himself
      left it; and this original manuscript has been followed with rigid
      accuracy in the text of the present edition.

          History of the United States</i> (Department of State, 1894) is a
          presentation of a literal print of the original journal, indicating by
          the use of larger and smaller type and by explanatory words the

      The editor has compared carefully with Madison&#39;s report, as the notes
      will show, the incomplete and less important records of the convention,
      kept by others. Of these, the best known is that of Robert Yates, a
      delegate in the convention from New York, who took notes from the time he
      entered the convention, May 25, to July 5, when he went home to oppose
      what he foresaw would be the result of the convention&#39;s labors. These
      notes were published in 1821 (Albany), edited by Yates&#39;s colleague in
      the convention, John Lansing, under the title, <i>Secret Proceedings and
      Debates of the Convention Assembled at Philadelphia, in the Year 1787, for
      the Purpose of Forming the Constitution of the United States of America</i>.
      This was afterwards reprinted in several editions and in the three
      editions of <i>The Debates on the Federal Constitution</i>, by Jonathan
      Elliot (Washington, 1827-1836). Madison pronounced Yates&#39;s notes
      "Crude and broken." "When I looked over them some years ago," he wrote to
      J. C. Cabell, February 2, 1829, "I was struck with the number of instances
      in which he had totally mistaken what was said by me, or given it in
      scraps and terms which, taken without the developments or qualifications
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexi" id="pagexi"></a>[pg&nbsp;xi]</span>
      accompanying them, had an import essentially different from what was
      intended." Yates&#39;s notes were colored by his prejudices, which were
      strong against the leaders of the convention, but, making allowance for
      this and for their incompleteness, they are of high value and rank next to
      Madison&#39;s in importance.

    <p class="indent">
      Rufus King, a delegate from Massachusetts, kept a number of notes,
      scattered and imperfect, which were not published till 1894, when they
      appeared in King&#39;s <i>Life and Correspondence of Rufus King</i> (New
      York: Putnam&#39;s).
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      William Pierce, a delegate from Georgia, made some memoranda of the
      proceedings of the convention, and brief and interesting sketches of all
      the delegates, which were first printed in <i>The Savannah Georgian</i>,
      April, 18-28, 1828, and reprinted in <i>The American Historical Review</i>
      for January, 1898.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The notes of Yates, King, and Pierce are the only unofficial record of the
      convention extant, besides Madison&#39;s, and their chief value is in
      connection with the Madison record, which in the main they support, and
      which occasionally they elucidate.

      December 30, 1818, Charles Pinckney wrote to John Quincy Adams that he had
      made more notes of the convention than any other member except Madison,
      but they were never published and have been lost or destroyed.<a

      In 1819 (Boston) was published the <i>Journal, Acts and Proceedings of the
      Convention</i>, etc., under the supervision of John Quincy Adams,
      Secretary of State, by authority of a joint resolution of Congress of
      March 27, 1818. This was the official journal of the convention, which the

      name="pagexii" id="pagexii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xii]</span> having previously
      burned all other papers of the convention in his possession. March 16,
      1796, Washington deposited the papers Jackson had given him with the
      Secretary of State, Timothy Pickering. They consisted of three volumes,&mdash;the
      journal of the convention, the journal of the proceedings of the Committee
      of the Whole of the convention, and a list of yeas and nays, beside a
      printed draft of the Constitution as reported August 6th, showing erasures
      and amendments afterwards adopted, and the Virginia plan in different
      stages of development.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      In preparing the matter for publication Secretary Adams found that for
      Friday, September 14, and Saturday, September 15, the journal was a mere
      fragment, and Madison was applied to and completed it from his minutes.
      From General B. Bloomfield, executor of the estate of David Brearley, a
      delegate in the convention from New Jersey, Adams obtained a few
      additional papers, and from Charles Pinckney a copy of what purported to
      be the plan of a constitution submitted by him to the convention. All of
      these papers, with some others, appeared in the edition of 1819, which was
      a singularly accurate publication, as comparison by the present editor of
      the printed page with the original papers has shown.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The Pinckney plan, as it appeared in this edition of the journal, was
      incorporated by Madison into his record, as he had not secured a copy of
      it when the convention was sitting. But the draft furnished to Secretary
      Adams in 1818, and the plan presented by Pinckney to the convention in
      1787 were not identical, as Madison conclusively proved in his note to his
      journal, in his letter to Jared Sparks of November 25, 1831, and in
      several other letters, in all of which he showed that the draft did not
      agree in several important respects with Pinckney&#39;s own votes and
      motions in the convention, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="pagexiii"
      id="pagexiii"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiii]</span> that there were important
      discrepancies between it and Pinckney&#39;s <i>Observations on the Plan of
      Government</i>, a pamphlet printed shortly after the convention adjourned.<a
      name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6"

    <p class="indent">
      It is, indeed, inconceivable that the convention should have incorporated
      into the constitution so many of the provisions of the Pinckney draft, and
      that at the same time so little reference should have been made to it in
      the course of the debates; and it is equally extraordinary that the
      contemporaries of Pinckney did not accord to him the chief paternity of
      the Constitution, which honor would have belonged to him if the draft he
      sent to Mr. Adams in 1818 had been the one he actually offered the
      convention in the first week of its session. The editor has made a careful
      examination of the original manuscripts in the case. They consist (1) of
      Mr. Pinckney&#39;s letter to Mr. Adams of December 12, 1818, written from
      Winyaw, S.&nbsp;C., while Pinckney was temporarily absent from Charleston,
      acknowledging Mr. Adams&#39;s request for the draft, (2) his letter of
      December 30, written from Charleston, transmitting the draft, and (3) the
      draft. The penmanship of all three papers is contemporaneous, and the
      letter of December 30 and the draft were written with the same pen and
      ink. This may possibly admit of a difference of opinion, because the draft
      is in a somewhat larger chirography than the letter, having been, as
      befitted its importance, written more carefully. But the letter and the
      draft are written upon the same paper, and this paper was not made when
      the convention sat in 1787. There are several sheets of the draft and one
      of the letter, and all bear the same water-mark&mdash;"Russell &amp; Co.
      1797." The draft cannot, therefore, claim to be the original Pinckney
      plan, and was palpably made for the occasion, from <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="pagexiv" id="pagexiv"></a>[pg&nbsp;xiv]</span> Mr. Pinckney&#39;s
      original notes doubtless, aided and modified by a copy of the Constitution
      itself. Thirty years had elapsed since the close of the Constitutional
      Convention when the draft was compiled, and its incorrectness is not a
      circumstance to occasion great wonder.<a name="FNanchor_7_7"

          negative every good system of Government, which must, in the nature of

          be easier to prevail on the latter, in the course of the
          deliberations, to give up their equality for the sake of an effective
          Government, than on taking the field of discussion to disarm

          brings to view things when he is engaged in deep argumentation, that
          render all the labor of reasoning easy and pleasing. But with all
          these powers he is fickle and inconstant,&mdash;never pursuing one
          train of thinking,&mdash;nor ever regular. He has gone through a very
          extensive course of reading, and is acquainted with all the sciences.
          No Man has more wit,&mdash;nor can any one engage the attention more
          than M<sup>r</sup> Morris. He was bred to the Law, but I am told he
          disliked the profession, and turned Merchant. He is engaged in some
          great mercantile matters with his namesake, M<sup>r</sup> Rob<sup>t</sup>
          Morris. This Gentleman is about 38 years old, he has been unfortunate
          in losing one of his Legs, and getting all the flesh taken off his
          right arm by a scald, when a youth."&mdash;Pierce&#39;s Notes, <i>Am.

            "The inclosed address, of which I presume your Excellency has
            received a duplicate, was returned to me from New York after my
            arrival in this State. I flattered myself that our Legislature,
            which convened on monday last, would have receded from the
            resolution therein refer&#39;d to, and have complied with the
            recommendation of Congress in sending deligates to the federal
            convention. The upper house, or Governor, &amp; Council, embraced
            the measure, but it was negatived in the house of Assembly by a
            large majority, notwithstanding the greatest exertions were made to
            support it.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "Being disappointed in their expectations, the minority in the
            administration and all the worthy citizens of this State, whose
            minds are well informd regreting the peculiarities of their
            Situation place their fullest confidence in the wisdom &amp;
            moderation of the national council, and indulge the warmest hopes of
            being favorably consider&#39;d in their deliberations. From these
            deliberations they anticipate a political System which must finally
            be adopted &amp; from which will result the Safety, the honour,
            &amp; the happiness of the United States.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "Permit me, Sir, to observe, that the measures of our present
            Legislature do not exhibit the real character of the State. They are
            equally reprobated, &amp; abhored by Gentlemen of the learned
            professions, by the whole mercantile body, &amp; by most of the
            respectable farmers and mechanicks. The majority of the
            administration is composed of a licentious number of men, destitute
            of education, and many of them, Void of principle. From anarchy and
            confusion they derive their temporary consequence, and this they
            endeavor to prolong by debauching the minds of the common people,
            whose attention is wholly directed to the Abolition of debts both
            public &amp; private. With these are associated the disaffected of
            every description, particularly those who were unfriendly during the
            war. Their paper money System, founded in oppression &amp; fraud,
            they are determined to Support at every hazard. And rather than
            relinquish their favorite pursuit they trample upon the most sacred
            obligations. As a proof of this they refused to comply with a
            requisition of Congress for repealing all laws repugnant to the
            treaty of peace with Great Britain, and urged as their principal
            reason, that it would be calling in question the propriety of their
            former measures.

          <p class="indent">
            "These evils may be attributed, partly to the extreme freedom of our
            own constitution, and partly to the want of energy in the federal
            Union: And it is greatly to be apprehended that they cannot Speedily
            be removed but by uncommon and very serious exertions. It is
            fortunate however that the wealth and resources of this State are
            chiefly in possion of the well Affected, &amp; that they are

      He expressed his regret, that it should fall to him, rather than those,
      who were of longer standing in life and political experience, to open the
      great subject of their mission. But, as the convention had originated from
      Virginia, and his colleagues supposed that some proposition was expected
      from them, they had imposed this task on him.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      He then commented on the difficulty of the crisis, and the necessity of
      preventing the fulfilment of the prophecies of the American downfal.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      He observed that in revising the f&oelig;deral system <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page14" id="page14"></a>[pg&nbsp;14]</span> we ought to inquire 1.
      into the properties, which such a government ought to possess, 2. the
      defects of the confederation, 3. the danger of our situation &amp; 4. the
      remedy.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      1. The Character of such a government ought to secure 1. against foreign
      invasion: 2. against dissensions between members of the Union, or
      seditions in particular States: 3. to procure to the several States
      various blessings, of which an isolated situation was incapable: 4. to be
      able to defend itself against encroachment: &amp; 5. to be paramount to
      the state constitutions.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      2. In speaking of the defects of the confederation he professed a high
      respect for its authors, and considered them as having done all that
      patriots could do, in the then infancy of the science, of constitutions,
      &amp; of confederacies,&mdash;when the inefficiency of requisitions was
      unknown&mdash;no commercial discord had arisen among any States&mdash;no
      rebellion had appeared as in Mass<sup>ts</sup>&mdash;foreign debts had not
      become urgent&mdash;the havoc of paper money had not been foreseen&mdash;treaties
      had not been violated&mdash;and perhaps nothing better could be obtained
      from the jealousy of the states with regard to their sovereignty.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      He then proceeded to enumerate the defects. 1. that the confederation
      produced no security against foreign invasion; congress not being
      permitted to prevent a war nor to support it by their own authority&mdash;Of
      this he cited many examples; most of which tended to shew, that they could
      not cause infractions of treaties or of the law of nations to be punished:
      that particular states might by their conduct provoke war without
      controul; and that neither militia nor draughts being fit for defence on
      such occasions, enlistments only could be successful, and these could not
      be executed without money.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      2, that the f&oelig;deral government could not check <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page15" id="page15"></a>[pg&nbsp;15]</span> the quarrels between
      states, nor a rebellion in any, not having constitutional power nor means
      to interpose according to the exigency.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      3, that there were many advantages, which the U. S.&nbsp;might acquire,
      which were not attainable under the confederation&mdash;such as a
      productive impost&mdash;counteraction of the commercial regulations of
      other nations&mdash;pushing of commerce ad libitum,&mdash;&amp;c &amp;c.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      4, that the f&oelig;deral government could not defend itself against
      encroachments from the states.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      5, that it was not even paramount to the state constitutions, ratified as
      it was in many of the states.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      3. He next reviewed the danger of our situation, appealed to the sense of
      the best friends of the U. S. the prospect of anarchy from the laxity of
      government every where; and to other considerations.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      4. He then proceeded to the remedy; the basis of which he said must be the
      republican principle.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      He proposed as conformable to his ideas the following resolutions, which
      he explained one by one.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      1. Resolved that the articles of Confederation ought to be so corrected
      &amp; enlarged as to accomplish the objects proposed by their institution;
      namely, "common defence, security of liberty, and general welfare."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      2. Res<sup>d</sup> therefore that the rights of suffrage in the National
      Legislature ought to be proportioned to the Quotas of contribution, or to
      the number of free inhabitants, as the one or the other rule may seem best
      in different cases.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      3. Res<sup>d</sup> that the National Legislature ought to consist of two
      branches.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      4. Res<sup>d</sup> that the members of the first branch of the National
      Legislature ought to be elected by the people of the several States every
      &mdash;&mdash; for the term of &mdash;&mdash;; to be of the age of &mdash;&mdash;
      years at least, to receive liberal stipends by which they may be
      compensated for the devotion of their time to the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page16" id="page16"></a>[pg&nbsp;16]</span> public service; to be
      ineligible to any office established by a particular State, or under the
      authority of the United States, except those peculiarly belong to the
      functions of the first branch, during the term of service, and for the
      space of &mdash;&mdash; after its expiration; to be incapable of
      re-election for the space of &mdash;&mdash; after the expiration of their
      term of service, and to be subject to recall.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      5. Resol<sup>d</sup> that the members of the second branch of the National
      Legislature ought to be elected by those of the first, out of a proper
      number of persons nominated by the individual Legislatures, to be of the
      age of &mdash;&mdash; years at least; to hold their offices for a term
      sufficient to ensure their independency; to receive liberal stipends, by
      which they may be compensated for the devotion of their time to the public
      service; and to be ineligible to any office established by a particular
      State, or under the authority of the United States, except those
      peculiarly belonging to the functions of the second branch, during the
      term of service; and for the space of &mdash;&mdash; after the expiration
      thereof.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      6. Resolved that each branch ought to possess the right of originating
      Acts; that the National Legislature ought to be empowered to enjoy the
      Legislative Rights vested in Congress by the Confederation &amp; moreover
      to legislate in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent, or
      in which the harmony of the United States may be interrupted by the
      exercise of individual Legislation; to negative all laws passed by the
      several States contravening in the opinion of the National Legislature the
      articles of Union; and to call forth the force of the Union ag<sup>st</sup>
      any member of the Union failing to fulfil its duty under the articles
      thereof.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      7. Res<sup>d</sup> that a National Executive be instituted; to be chosen
      by the National Legislature for the term of &mdash;&mdash; years, to
      receive punctually at stated <span class="pagenum"><a name="page17"
      id="page17"></a>[pg&nbsp;17]</span> times, a fixed compensation for the
      services rendered, in which no increase or diminution shall be made so as
      to affect the Magistracy, existing at the time of increase or diminution,
      and to be ineligible a second time; and that besides a general authority
      to execute the national laws, it ought to enjoy the Executive rights
      vested in Congress by the Confederation.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      8. Res<sup>d</sup> that the Executive and a convenient number of the
      National Judiciary, ought to compose a Council of revision with authority
      to examine every act of the National Legislature before it shall operate,
      &amp; every act of a particular Legislature before a Negative thereon
      shall be final; and that the dissent of the said Council shall amount to a
      rejection, unless the Act of the National Legislature be again passed, or
      that of a particular Legislature be again negatived by &mdash;&mdash; of
      the members of each branch.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      9. Res<sup>d</sup> that a National Judiciary be established to consist of
      one or more supreme tribunals, and of inferior tribunals to be chosen by
      the National Legislature, to hold their offices during good behaviour; and
      to receive punctually at stated times fixed compensation for their
      services, in which no increase or diminution shall be made so as to affect
      the persons actually in office at the time of such increase or diminution.
      That the jurisdiction of the inferior tribunals shall be to hear &amp;
      determine in the first instance, and of the supreme tribunal to hear and
      determine in the dernier resort, all Piracies &amp; felonies on the high
      seas, captures from an enemy: cases in which foreigners or Citizens of
      other States applying to such jurisdictions may be interested, or which
      respect the collection of the National revenues; impeachments of any
      national officers, and questions which may involve the national peace and
      harmony.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      10. Resolv<sup>d</sup> that provision ought to be made for the admission
      of States lawfully arising within the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page18" id="page18"></a>[pg&nbsp;18]</span> limits of the United
      States, whether from a voluntary junction of Government &amp; Territory or
      otherwise, with the consent of a number of voices in the National
      Legislature less than the whole.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      11. Res<sup>d</sup> that a Republican Government &amp; the territory of
      each State, except in the instance of a voluntary junction of Government
      &amp; territory, ought to be guarantied by the United States to each
      State.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      12. Res<sup>d</sup> that provision ought to be made for the continuance of
      Congress and their authorities and privileges, until a given day after the
      reform of the articles of Union shall be adopted, and for the completion
      of all their engagements.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      13. Res<sup>d</sup> that provision ought to be made for the amendment of
      the Articles of Union whensoever it shall seem necessary, and that the
      assent of the National Legislature ought not to be required thereto.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      14. Res<sup>d</sup> that the Legislative Executive &amp; Judiciary powers
      within the several States ought to be bound by oath to support the
      articles of Union.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      15. Res<sup>d</sup> that the amendments which shall be offered to the
      Confederation, by the Convention ought at a proper time, or times, after
      the approbation of Congress to be submitted to an assembly or assemblies
      of Representatives, recommended by the several Legislatures to be
      expressly chosen by the people to consider &amp; decide thereon.

            arrangement of the articles&mdash;yet they were all substantially

            view the attempt to amend the existing Confederation (then a very
            favorite idea of a number) &amp; proceeding de novo&mdash;of a

            adopted in the sequel except as to the Senate &amp; giving more
            power to the Executive than I intended&mdash;the force of vote which
            the small &amp; middling states had in the Convention prevented our
            obtaining a proportional representation in more than one branch

            giving the exclusive Power to the Senate to declare War thinking it

        <p class="indent">
          Madison wrote the following note to accompany his journal:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent">
            "The length of the Document laid before the Convention, and other
            circumstances having prevented the taking of a copy at the time,
            that which is here inserted was taken from the paper furnished to
            the Secretary of State, and contained in the Journal of the
            Convention published in 1819. On comparing the paper with the
            Constitution in its final form, or in some of its Stages; and with
            the propositions, and speeches of M<sup>r</sup> Pinckney in the
            Convention, it would seem that considerable errour must have crept
            into the paper; occasioned possibly by the loss of the Document laid
            before the convention (neither that nor the Resolutions offered by M<sup>r</sup>
            Patterson being among the preserved papers) and by a consequent
            resort for a copy to the rough draught, in which erasures and
            interlineations following what passed in the convention, might be
            confounded with the original text, and after a lapse of more than
            thirty years, confounded also in the memory of the author.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "There is in the paper a similarity in some cases, and an identity
            in others, with details, expressions, and definitions, the results
            of critical discussions and modifications that can not be ascribed
            to accident or anticipation.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "Examples may be noticed in Article VIII of the paper; which is
            remarkable also for the circumstance, that whilst it specifies the
            functions of the President, no provision is contained in the paper
            for the election of such an officer, nor indeed for the appointment
            of any executive magistracy; notwithstanding the evident purpose of
            the author to provide an <i>entire</i> plan of a Federal Government.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "Again, in several instances where the paper corresponds with the
            Constitution, it is at variance with the ideas of M<sup>r</sup>
            Pinckney, as decidedly expressed in his propositions, and in his
            arguments, the former in the Journal of the Convention, the latter
            in the report of its debates: Thus in Art: VIII of the paper,
            provision is made for removing the President by impeachment; when it
            appears that in the convention, July 20. he was opposed to any
            impeachability of the Executive magistrate: In Art: III, it is
            required that all money-bills shall originate in the first Branch of
            the Legislature; which he strenuously opposed Aug: 8 and again Aug:
            11: In Art: V members of each House are made ineligible to, as well
            as incapable of holding, any office under the union &amp;c. as was
            the case at one Stage of the Constitution; a disqualification highly
            disapproved and opposed by him Aug: 14.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "A still more conclusive evidence of errour in the paper is seen in
            Art: III, which provides, as the Constitution does, that the first
            Branch of the Legislature shall be chosen by the people of the
            several States; whilst it appears that on the 6<sup>th</sup> of
            June, a few days only after the Draft was laid before the
            convention, its author opposed that mode of choice, urging &amp;
            proposing in place of it, an election by the Legislatures of the
            several States.

      articles of Confederation ought to be so corrected &amp; enlarged, as to
      accomplish the objects proposed by their institution; namely, common
      defence, security of liberty, and general welfare,&mdash;should be
      postponed, in order to consider the 3 following:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="indent">
        1. that a union of the States merely federal will not accomplish the

      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        2. that no treaty or treaties among the whole or part of the States, as
        individual Sovereignties, would be sufficient.

        3. that a <i>national</i> Government ought to be established <span

        consisting of a <i>supreme</i> Legislative, Executive &amp; Judiciary.

    </blockquote>
    <p class="indent">
      The motion for postponing was seconded by M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      Morris and unanimously agreed to.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Some verbal criticisms were raised ag<sup>st</sup> the first proposition,
      and it was agreed on motion of M<sup>r</sup> Butler seconded by M<sup>r</sup>
      Randolph, to pass on to the third, which underwent a discussion, less
      however on its general merits than on the force and extent of the
      particular terms <i>national &amp; supreme</i>.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Charles Pinkney wished to know of M<sup>r</sup> Randolph,
      whether he meant to abolish the State Govern<sup>ts</sup> altogether. M<sup>r</sup>
      R. replied that he meant by these general propositions merely to introduce
      the particular ones which explained the outlines of the system he had in
      view.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler said he had not made up his mind on the subject, and
      was open to the light which discussion might throw on it. After some
      general observations he concluded with saying that he had opposed the
      grant of powers to Cong<sup>s</sup> heretofore, because the whole power
      was vested in one body. The proposed distribution of the powers into
      different bodies changed the case, and would induce him to go great
      lengths.

          accompany his public speaking, and that strange new England cant which
          runs through his public as well as his private speaking make

      assenting to any change of the rule of suffrage, and in case such a change
      should be fixed on, it might become their duty to retire from the
      Convention.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris observed that the valuable assistance
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page38" id="page38"></a>[pg&nbsp;38]</span>
      of those members could not be lost without real concern, and that so early
      a proof of discord in the Convention as the secession of a State, would
      add much to the regret; that the change proposed was however so
      fundamental an article in a national Gov<sup>t</sup>, that it could not be
      dispensed with.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison observed that whatever reason might have existed for
      the equality of suffrage when the Union was a federal one among sovereign
      States, it must cease when a National Governm<sup>t</sup>, should be put
      into the place. In the former case, the acts of Cong<sup>s</sup> depended
      so much for their efficacy on the cooperation of the States, that these
      had a weight both within &amp; without Congress, nearly in proportion to
      their extent and importance. In the latter case, as the acts of the Gen<sup>l</sup>,
      Gov<sup>t</sup>, would take effect without the intervention of the State
      legislatures, a vote from a small State w<sup>d</sup>, have the same
      efficacy &amp; importance as a vote from a large one, and there was the
      same reason for different numbers of representatives from different
      States, as from Counties of different extents within particular States. He
      suggested as an expedient for at once taking the sense of the members on
      this point and saving the Delaware deputies from embarrassment, that the
      question should be taken in Committee, and the clause on report to the
      House, be postponed without a question there. This however did not appear
      to satisfy Mr. Read.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      By several it was observed that no just construction of the Act of
      Delaware, could require or justify a secession of her deputies, even if
      the resolution were to be carried thro&#39; the House as well as the
      Committee. It was finally agreed however that the clause should be
      postponed: it being understood that in the event the proposed change of
      representation would certainly be agreed to, no objection or difficulty
      being started from any other quarter than from Delaware.

    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The 3<sup>d</sup> Resolution "that the national Legislature ought to
      consist of two branches" was agreed to without debate or dissent, except
      that of Pennsylvania, given probably from complaisance to Doc<sup>r</sup>

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman opposed the election by the people, insisting that
      it ought to be by the State Legislatures. The people he said, immediately
      should have <span class="pagenum"><a name="page40" id="page40"></a>[pg&nbsp;40]</span>
      as little to do as may be about the Government. They want information and
      are constantly liable to be misled.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry. The evils we experience flow from the excess of
      democracy. The people do not want virtue, but are the dupes of pretended
      patriots. In Mass<sup>ts</sup> it had been fully confirmed by experience
      that they are daily misled into the most baneful measures and opinions by
      the false reports circulated by designing men, and which no one on the
      spot can refute. One principal evil arises from the want of due provision
      for those employed in the administration of Governm<sup>t</sup>. It would
      seem to be a maxim of democracy to starve the public servants. He
      mentioned the popular clamour in Mass<sup>ts</sup> for the reduction of
      salaries and the attack made on that of the Gov<sup>r</sup> though secured
      by the spirit of the Constitution itself. He had he said been too
      republican heretofore: he was still however republican, but had been
      taught by experience the danger of the levelling spirit.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Mason argued strongly for an election of the larger branch
      by the people. It was to be the grand depository of the democratic
      principle of the Gov<sup>t</sup>. It was, so to speak, to be our House of
      Commons&mdash;It ought to know &amp; sympathize with every part of the
      community; and ought therefore to be taken not only from different parts
      of the whole republic, but also from different districts of the larger
      members of it, which had in several instances particularly in Virg<sup>a</sup>,
      different interests and views arising from difference of produce, of
      habits &amp;c &amp;c. He admitted that we had been too democratic but was
      afraid we s<sup>d</sup> incautiously run into the opposite extreme. We
      ought to attend to the rights of every class of the people. He had often
      wondered at the indifference of the superior classes of society to this
      dictate of humanity &amp; policy, considering that however <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page41" id="page41"></a>[pg&nbsp;41]</span>
      affluent their circumstances, or elevated their situations, might be, the
      course of a few years, not only might but certainly would, distribute
      their posterity throughout the lowest classes of Society. Every selfish
      motive therefore, every family attachment, ought to recommend such a
      system of policy as would provide no less carefully for the rights and
      happiness of the lowest than of the highest orders of Citizens.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson contended strenuously for drawing the most numerous
      branch of the Legislature immediately from the people. He was for raising
      the federal pyramid to a considerable altitude, and for that reason wished
      to give it as broad a basis as possible. No government could long subsist
      without the confidence of the people. In a republican Government this
      confidence was peculiarly essential. He also thought it wrong to increase
      the weight of the State Legislatures by making them the electors of the
      national Legislature. All interference between the general and local
      Governm<sup>ts</sup> should be obviated as much as possible. On
      examination it would be found that the opposition of States to federal
      measures had proceeded much more from the officers of the States, than
      from the people at large.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison considered the popular election of one branch of the
      national Legislature as essential to every plan of free Government. He
      observed that in some of the States one branch of the Legislature was
      composed of men already removed from the people by an intervening body of
      electors. That if the first branch of the general legislature should be
      elected by the State Legislatures, the second branch elected by the first&mdash;the
      Executive by the second together with the first; and other appointments
      again made for subordinate purposes by the Executive, the people would be
      lost sight of altogether; and the necessary sympathy between them and
      their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page42" id="page42"></a>[pg&nbsp;42]</span>
      rulers and officers, too little felt. He was an advocate for the policy of
      refining the popular appointments by successive filtrations, but thought
      it might be pushed too far. He wished the expedient to be resorted to only
      in the appointment of the second branch of the Legislature, and in the
      Executive &amp; judiciary branches of the Government. He thought too that
      the great fabric to be raised would be more stable and durable, if it
      should rest on the solid foundation of the people themselves, than if it
      should stand merely on the pillars of the Legislatures.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry did not like the election by the people. The maxims
      taken from the British Constitution were often fallacious when applied to
      our situation which was extremely different. Experience he said had shewn
      that the State legislatures drawn immediately from the people did not
      always possess their confidence. He had no objection however to an
      election by the people if it were so qualified that men of honor &amp;
      character might not be unwilling to be joined in the appointments. He
      seemed to think the people might nominate a certain number out of which
      the State legislatures should be bound to choose.<a name="FNanchor_42_42"

      M<sup>r</sup> Butler apprehended that the taking so many powers out of the

      preserve; and called on M<sup>r</sup> Randolph the mover of the

      M<sup>r</sup> King reminded the Committee that the choice of the second
      branch as proposed (by M<sup>r</sup> Spaight) viz. by the State
      Legislatures would be impracticable, unless it was to be very numerous, or
      <i>the idea of proportion</i> among the States was to be disregarded.
      According to this <i>idea</i>, there must be 80 or 100 members to entitle
      Delaware to the choice of one of them.&mdash;M<sup>r</sup> Spaight
      withdrew his motion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson opposed both a nomination by the State Legislatures,
      and an election by the first branch of the national Legislature, because
      the second branch of the latter, ought to be independent of both. He
      thought both branches of the National Legislature ought to be chosen by
      the people, but was not prepared with a specific proposition. He suggested
      the mode of chusing the Senate of N.&nbsp;York to wit of uniting several
      election districts for one branch, in chusing members for the other
      branch, as a good model.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison observed that such a mode would destroy the
      influence of the smaller States associated with larger ones in the same
      district; as the latter would chuse from within themselves, altho&#39;
      better men might be found in the former. The election of Senators in Virg<sup>a</sup>
      where large &amp; small counties were often formed into one district for
      the purpose, had illustrated this consequence. Local partiality, would
      often prefer a resident within the County or State, to a candidate of
      superior merit residing out of it. Less merit also in a resident would be

      fabric. If we were in a situation to copy it he did not know that he
      should be opposed to it; but the fixt genius of the people of America
      required a different form of Government. He could not see why the great
      requisites for the Executive department, vigor, dispatch &amp;
      responsibility could not be found in three men, as well as in one man. The
      Executive ought to be independent. It ought <span class="pagenum"><a

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson said that unity in the Executive instead of being the
      fetus of monarchy would be the best safeguard against tyranny. He repeated
      that he was not governed by the British Model which was inapplicable to
      the situation of this Country; the extent of which was so great, and the
      manners so republican, that nothing but a great confederated Republic

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison thought it would be proper, before a choice sh<sup>d</sup>
      be made between a unity and a plurality in the Executive, to fix the
      extent of the Executive authority; that as certain powers were in their
      nature Executive, and must be given to that departm<sup>t</sup> whether
      administered by one or more persons, a definition of their extent would
      assist the judgment in determining how far they might be safely entrusted
      to a single officer. He accordingly moved that so much of the clause
      before the Committee as related to the powers of the Executive sh<sup>d</sup>
      be struck out &amp; that after the words "that a national Executive ought
      to be instituted" there be inserted the words following viz. "with power
      to carry into effect the national laws, to appoint to offices in cases not
      otherwise provided for, and to execute such other powers "not Legislative
      nor Judiciary in their nature," as may from time to time be delegated by
      the national Legislature." The words <span class="pagenum"><a name="page53"

      their nature" were added to the proposed amendment, in consequence of a
      suggestion by Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney that improper powers might otherwise
      be delegated.

      said they were unnecessary, the object of them being included in the

      did not however see any inconveniency in retaining them, and cases might

      State partizans, as tending to supersede altogether the State authorities.
      He thought the Community not yet ripe for stripping the States of their
      powers, even such as might not be requisite for local purposes. He was for
      waiting till the people <span class="pagenum"><a name="page57" id="page57"></a>[pg&nbsp;57]</span>
      should feel more the necessity of it. He seemed to prefer the taking the
      suffrages of the States, instead of Electors, or letting the Legislatures
      nominate, and the electors appoint. He was not clear that the people ought
      to act directly even in the choice of electors, being too little informed
      of personal characters in large districts, and liable to deceptions.

      to writing, that he might with the permission of the Committee read
      instead of speaking them. M<sup>r</sup> Wilson made an offer to read the
      paper, which was accepted. The following is a literal copy of the paper:
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="indent">
        Sir,
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        It is with reluctance that I rise to express a disapprobation of any one
        article of the plan for which we are so much obliged to the honorable
        gentleman who laid it before us. From its first reading I have borne a
        good will to it, and in general wished it success. In this particular of
        salaries to the Executive branch I happen to differ; and as my opinion
        may appear new and chimerical, it is only from a persuasion that it is
        right, and from a sense of duty that I hazard it. The Committee will
        judge of my reasons when they have heard them, and their judgment may
        possibly change mine.&mdash;I think I see inconveniences in the
        appointment of salaries; I see none in refusing them, but on the
        contrary, great advantages.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Sir, there are two passions which have a powerful influence on the
        affairs of men. These are ambition and avarice; the love of power, and
        the love of money. Separately each of these has great force in prompting
        men to action; but when united in view of the same object, they have in
        many minds the most violent effects. Place before the eyes of such men,
        a post of <i>honour</i> that shall be at the same time a place of <i>profit</i>,
        and they will move heaven and earth to obtain it. The vast number of
        such places it is that renders the British Government so tempestuous.
        The struggles for them are the true sources of all those factions which
        are perpetually dividing the Nation, distracting its Councils, hurrying
        sometimes into fruitless &amp; mischievous wars, and often compelling a
        submission to dishonorable terms of peace.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        <span class="pagenum"><a name="page59" id="page59"></a>[pg&nbsp;59]</span>
        And of what kind are the men that will strive for this profitable
        pre-eminence, through all the bustle of cabal, the heat of contention,
        the infinite mutual abuse of parties, tearing to pieces the best of
        characters? It will not be the wise and moderate, the lovers of peace
        and good order, the men fittest for the trust. It will be the bold and
        the violent, the men of strong passions and indefatigable activity in
        their selfish pursuits. These will thrust themselves into your
        Government and be your rulers.&mdash;And these too will be mistaken in
        the expected happiness of their situation: For their vanquished
        competitors of the same spirit, and from the same motives will
        perpetually be endeavouring to distress their administration, thwart
        their measures, and render them odious to the people.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Besides these evils, Sir, tho&#39; we may set out in the beginning with
        moderate salaries, we shall find that such will not be of long
        continuance. Reasons will never be wanting for proposed augmentations.
        And there will always be a party for giving more to the rulers, that the
        rulers may be able in return to give more to them. Hence as all history
        informs us, there has been in every State &amp; Kingdom a constant kind
        of warfare between the Governing &amp; Governed; the one striving to
        obtain more for its support, and the other to pay less. And this has
        alone occasioned great convulsions, actual civil wars, ending either in
        dethroning of the Princes, or enslaving of the people. Generally indeed
        the ruling power carries its point, the revenues of princes constantly
        increasing, and we see that they are never satisfied, but always in want
        of more. The more the people are discontented with the oppression of
        taxes; the greater need the prince has of money to distribute among his
        partizans and pay the troops that are to suppress all resistance, and
        enable him to plunder at pleasure. There is scarce a king in an hundred
        who would not, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page60" id="page60"></a>[pg&nbsp;60]</span>
        if he could, follow the example of Pharoah, get first all the people&#39;s
        money, then all their lands, and then make them and their children
        servants for ever. It will be said, that we don&#39;t propose to
        establish Kings. I know it. But there is a natural inclination in
        mankind to Kingly Government. It sometimes relieves them from
        Aristocratic domination. They had rather have one tyrant than five
        hundred. It gives more of the appearance of equality among Citizens, and
        that they like. I am apprehensive therefore, perhaps too apprehensive,
        that the Government of these States, may in future times, end in a
        Monarchy. But this Catastrophe I think may be long delayed, if in our
        proposed System we do not sow the seeds of contention, faction &amp;
        tumult, by making our posts of honor, places of profit. If we do, I fear
        that tho&#39; we do employ at first a number, and not a single person,
        the number will in time be set aside, it will only nourish the f&oelig;tus
        of a King, as the honorable gentleman from Virginia very aptly expressed
        it, and a King will the sooner be set over us.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        It may be imagined by some that this is an Utopian Idea, and that we can
        never find men to serve us in the Executive department, without paying
        them well for their services. I conceive this to be a mistake. Some
        existing facts present themselves to me, which incline me to a contrary
        opinion. The high Sheriff of a County in England is an honorable office,
        but it is not a profitable one. It is rather expensive and therefore not
        sought for. But yet, it is executed and well executed, and usually by
        some of the principal Gentlemen of the County. In France, the office of
        Counsellor, or Member of their Judiciary Parliaments is more honorable.
        It is therefore purchased at a high price: There are indeed fees on the
        law proceedings, which are divided among them, but these fees do not
        amount to more than three Per <span class="pagenum"><a name="page61"
        id="page61"></a>[pg&nbsp;61]</span> Cent on the sum paid for the place.
        Therefore as legal interest is there at five PerC<sup>t</sup> they in
        fact pay two PerC<sup>t</sup> for being allowed to do the Judiciary
        business of the Nation, which is at the same time entirely exempt from
        the burden of paying them any salaries for their services. I do not
        however mean to recommend this as an eligible mode for our Judiciary
        department. I only bring the instance to shew that the pleasure of doing
        good &amp; serving their Country and the respect such conduct entitles
        them to, are sufficient motives with some minds to give up a great
        portion of their time to the Public, without the mean inducement of
        pecuniary satisfaction.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Another instance is that of a respectable Society who have made the
        experiment, and practised it with success more than one hundred years. I
        mean the Quakers. It is an established rule with them, that they are not
        to go to law; but in their controversies they must apply to their
        monthly, quarterly and yearly meetings. Committees of these sit with
        patience to hear the parties, and spend much time in composing their
        differences. In doing this, they are supported by a sense of duty, and
        the respect paid to usefulness. It is honorable to be so employed, but
        it is never made profitable by salaries, fees or perquisites. And indeed
        in all cases of Public service the less the profit the greater the
        honor.

      <p class="indent">
        To bring the matter nearer home, have we not seen, the great and most
        important of our offices, that of General of our armies executed for
        eight years together without the smallest salary, by a Patriot whom I
        will not now offend by any other praise; and this through fatigues and
        distresses in common with the other brave men his military friends &amp;
        companions, and the constant anxieties peculiar to his station? And
        shall we doubt finding three or four men in all the U. States, with
        public spirit enough to bear sitting in peaceful Council for <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="page62" id="page62"></a>[pg&nbsp;62]</span>
        perhaps an equal term, merely to preside over our civil concerns, and
        see that our laws are duly executed. Sir, I have a better opinion of our
        Country. I think we shall never be without a sufficient number of wise
        and good men to undertake and execute well and faithfully the office in
        question.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Sir. The saving of the salaries that may at first be proposed is not an
        object with me. The subsequent mischiefs of proposing them are what I
        apprehend. And therefore it is, that I move the amendment. If it is not
        seconded or accepted I must be contented with the satisfaction of having
        delivered my opinion frankly and done my duty.

      M<sup>r</sup> Mason. Some mode of displacing an unfit magistrate is
      rendered indispensable by the fallibility of those who choose, as well as
      by the corruptibility of the man chosen. He opposed decidedly the making

      fundamental principle of good Government.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Wilson observed that it would
      leave an equality of agency in the small with the great States; that it
      would enable a minority of the people to prevent y<sup>e</sup> removal of
      an officer who had rendered himself justly criminal in the eyes of a
      majority; that it would open a door for intrigues ag<sup>st</sup> him in
      States where his administration tho&#39; just might be unpopular, and
      might tempt him to pay court to particular States whose leading partizans
      he might fear, or wish to engage as his partizans. They both thought it
      bad policy to introduce such a mixture of the State authorities, where
      their agency could be otherwise supplied.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Dickinson considered the business as so important that no
      man ought to be silent or reserved. He went into a discourse of some
      length, the sum of which was, that the Legislative, Executive, &amp;
      Judiciary departments ought to be made as independ<sup>t</sup> <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page64" id="page64"></a>[pg&nbsp;64]</span> as
      possible; but that such an Executive as some seemed to have in
      contemplation was not consistent with a republic: that a firm Executive
      could only exist in a limited monarchy. In the British Gov<sup>t</sup>
      itself the weight of the Executive arises from the attachments which the
      Crown draws to itself, &amp; not merely from the force of its
      prerogatives. In place of these attachments we must look out for something
      else. One source of stability is the double branch of the Legislature. The
      division of the Country into distinct States formed the other principal
      source of stability. This division ought therefore to be maintained, and
      considerable powers to be left with the States. This was the ground of his
      consolation for the future fate of his Country. Without this, and in case
      of a consolidation of the States into one great Republic, we might read
      its fate in the history of smaller ones. A limited Monarchy he considered
      as <i>one</i> of the best Governments in the world. It was not <i>certain</i>
      that the same blessings were derivable from any other form. It was certain
      that equal blessings had never yet been derived from any of the republican
      form. A limited Monarchy however was out of the question. The spirit of
      the times&mdash;the state of our affairs forbade the experiment, if it
      were desireable. Was it possible moreover in the nature of things to
      introduce it even if these obstacles were less insuperable. A House of
      Nobles was essential to such a Gov<sup>t</sup> could these be created by a
      breath, or by a stroke of the pen? No. They were the growth of ages, and
      could only arise under a complication of circumstances none of which
      existed in this Country. But though a form the most perfect <i>perhaps</i>
      in itself be unattainable, we must not despair. If antient republics have
      been found to flourish for a moment only &amp; then vanish for ever, it
      only proves that they were badly constituted; and that we <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page65" id="page65"></a>[pg&nbsp;65]</span> ought
      to seek for every remedy for their diseases. One of these remedies he
      conceived to be the accidental lucky division of this Country into
      distinct States; a division which some seemed desirous to abolish
      altogether.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      As to the point of representation in the national Legislature as it might
      affect States of different sizes, he said it must probably end in mutual
      concession. He hoped that each State would retain an equal voice at least
      in one branch of the National Legislature, and supposed the sums paid
      within each State would form a better ratio for the other branch than
      either the number of inhabitants or the quantum of property.<a

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph opposed it with great earnestness, declaring that
      he should not do justice to the Country which sent him if he were silently
      to suffer the establishm<sup>t</sup> of a Unity in the Executive
      department. He felt an opposition to it which he believed he should
      continue to feel as long as he lived. He urged 1. that the permanent
      temper of the people was adverse to the very semblance of Monarchy. 2.
      that a unity was unnecessary a plurality being equally competent to all
      the objects of the department. 3. that the necessary confidence would
      never be reposed in a single Magistrate. 4. that the appointments would
      generally be in favor of some inhabitant near the center of the Community,
      and consequently the remote parts would not be on an equal footing. He was
      in favor of three members of the Executive to be drawn from different
      portions of the country.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler contended strongly for a single magistrate as most
      likely to answer the purpose of the remote parts. If one man should be
      appointed he would be responsible to the whole, and would be impartial to
      its interests. If three or more should be taken from as many districts,
      there would be a constant struggle for local advantages. In Military
      matters this would be particularly mischievous. He said his opinion on
      this point had been formed under the opportunity he had had of seeing the
      manner in which a plurality of military heads distracted Holland when
      threatened with invasion by the imperial troops. One man was for directing
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page67" id="page67"></a>[pg&nbsp;67]</span>

      The Question was resumed on motion of M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney, 2<sup>ded</sup>
      by M<sup>r</sup> Wilson, "shall the blank for the number of the Executive
      be filled with a single person?"
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson was in favor of the motion. It had been opposed by
      the gentleman from Virg<sup>a</sup> (Mr. Randolph) but the arguments used
      had not convinced him. He observed that the objections of M<sup>r</sup> R.
      were levelled not so much ag<sup>s</sup>t the measure itself, as ag<sup>st</sup>
      its unpopularity. If he could suppose that it would occasion a rejection
      of the plan of which it should form a part, though the part were an
      important one, yet he would give it up rather than lose the whole. On
      examination he could see no evidence of the alledged antipathy of the
      people. On the contrary he was persuaded that it does not exist. All know
      that a single magistrate is not a King. One fact has great weight with
      him. All the 13 States tho agreeing in scarce any other instance, agree in
      placing a single magistrate at the head of the Govern<sup>t</sup>. The
      idea of three heads has taken place in none. The degree of power is indeed
      different; but there are no co-ordinate heads. In addition to his former
      reasons for preferring a Unity, he would mention another. The <i>tranquillity</i>
      not less than the vigor of the Gov<sup>t</sup> he thought would be favored
      by it. Among three equal members, he foresaw nothing but uncontrouled,
      continued, &amp; violent animosities; which would not only interrupt the
      public administration; but diffuse their poison <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page68" id="page68"></a>[pg&nbsp;68]</span> thro&#39; the other
      branches of Gov<sup>t</sup>, thro&#39; the States, and at length thro&#39;
      the people at large. If the members were to be unequal in power the
      principle of opposition to the Unity was given up. If equal, the making
      them an odd number would not be a remedy. In Courts of Justice there are
      two sides only to a question. In the Legislative &amp; Executive departm<sup>ts</sup>
      questions have commonly many sides. Each member therefore might espouse a
      separate one &amp; no two agree.<a name="FNanchor_62_62"

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman. This matter is of great importance and ought to be
      well considered before it is determined. M<sup>r</sup> Wilson he said had
      observed that in each State a single magistrate was placed at the head of
      the Gov<sup>t</sup>. It was so he admitted, and properly so, and he wished
      the same policy to prevail in the federal Gov<sup>t</sup>. But then it
      should be also remarked that in all the States there was a Council of
      advice, without which the first magistrate could not act. A council he
      thought necessary to make the establishment acceptable to the people. Even
      in G. B. the King has a Council; and though he appoints it himself, its
      advice has its weight with him, and attracts the Confidence of the people.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry doubts whether the Judiciary ought to form a part of
      it, as they will have a sufficient check ag<sup>st</sup> encroachments on
      their own department by their exposition of the laws, which involved a
      power of deciding on their Constitutionality. In some States the Judges
      had actually set aside laws as being ag<sup>st</sup> the Constitution.
      This was done too with general approbation. It was quite foreign from the
      nature of y<sup>e</sup> office to make them judges of the policy of public
      measures. He moves to postpone the clause in order to propose "that the
      National Executive shall have a right to negative any Legislative act
      which shall not be afterwards passed by &mdash;&mdash; parts of each
      branch of the national Legislature."

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson thinks neither the original proposition nor the
      amendment goes far enough. If the Legislative Exetv &amp; Judiciary ought
      to be distinct &amp; independent, The Executive ought to have an absolute
      negative. Without such a self-defence the Legislature can at any moment
      sink it into non-existence. He was for varying the proposition in such a
      manner as to give the Executive &amp; Judiciary jointly an absolute
      negative.

      give the Executive an absolute negative on the laws. There was no danger
      they thought of such a power being too much exercised. It was mentioned by
      Col: Hamilton that the King of G. B. had not exerted his negative since
      the Revolution.

    <p class="indent">
      Doc<sup>r</sup> Franklin, said he was sorry to differ from his colleague
      for whom he had a very great respect, on any occasion, but he could not
      help it on this. He had had some experience of this check in the Executive
      on the Legislature, under the proprietary Government of Pen<sup>a</sup>.
      The negative of the Governor was constantly made use of to extort money.
      No good law whatever could be passed without a private bargain with him.
      An increase of his salary, or some donation, was always made a condition;
      till at last it became the regular practice, to have orders in his favor
      on the Treasury, presented along with the bills to be signed, so that he
      might actually receive the former before he should sign the latter. When
      the Indians were scalping the western people, and notice of it arrived,
      the concurrence of the Governor in the means of self-defence could not be
      got, till it was agreed that his Estate should be exempted from taxation:
      so that the people were to fight for the security of his property, whilst
      he was to bear no share of the burden. This was a mischevous sort of
      check. If the Executive was to have a Council, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page71" id="page71"></a>[pg&nbsp;71]</span> such a power would be
      less objectionable. It was true, the King of G. B. had not, as was said,
      exerted his negative since the Revolution; but that matter was easily
      explained. The bribes and emoluments now given to the members of
      parliament rendered it unnecessary, every thing being done according to
      the will of the Ministers. He was afraid, if a negative should be given as
      proposed, that more power and money would be demanded, till at last eno&#39;
      would be gotten to influence &amp; bribe the Legislature into a compleat
      subjection to the will of the Executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman was ag<sup>st</sup> enabling any one man to stop the
      will of the whole. No one man could be found so far above all the rest in
      wisdom. He thought we ought to avail ourselves of his wisdom in revising
      the laws, but not permit him to overrule the decided and cool opinions of
      the Legislature.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison supposed that if a proper proportion of each branch
      should be required to overrule the objections of the Executive, it would
      answer the same purpose as an absolute negative. It would rarely if ever
      happen that the Executive constituted as ours is proposed to be, would
      have firmness eno&#39; to resist the legislature, unless backed by a
      certain part of the body itself. The King of G. B. with all his splendid
      attributes would not be able to withstand y<sup>e</sup> unanimous and
      eager wishes of both houses of Parliament. To give such a prerogative
      would certainly be obnoxious to the temper of this Country; its present
      temper at least.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson believed as others did that this power would seldom
      be used. The Legislature would know that such a power existed, and would
      refrain from such laws, as it would be sure to defeat. Its silent
      operation would therefore preserve harmony and prevent mischief. The case
      of Pen<sup>a</sup> formerly was very different from its present case. The
      Executive was not then as now to be appointed by the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page72" id="page72"></a>[pg&nbsp;72]</span> people. It will not in
      this case as in the one cited be supported by the head of a Great Empire,
      actuated by a different &amp; sometimes opposite interest. The salary too
      is now proposed to be fixed by the Constitution, or if D<sup>r</sup> F.&#39;s
      idea should be adopted all salary whatever interdicted. The requiring a
      large proportion of each House to overrule the Executive check might do in
      peaceable times; but there might be tempestuous moments in which
      animosities may run high between the Executive and Legislative branches,
      and in which the former ought to be able to defend itself.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler had been in favor of a single Executive Magistrate;
      but could he have entertained an idea that a compleat negative on the laws
      was to be given him he certainly should have acted very differently. It
      had been observed that in all countries the Executive power is in a
      constant course of increase. This was certainly the case in G. B.
      Gentlemen seemed to think that we had nothing to apprehend from an abuse
      of the Executive power. But why might not a Cataline or a Cromwell arise
      in this Country as well as in others.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Bedford was opposed to every check on the Legislature, even
      the Council of Revision first proposed. He thought it would be sufficient
      to mark out in the Constitution the boundaries to the Legislative
      Authority, which would give all the requisite security to the rights of
      the other departments. The Representatives of the people were the best
      Judges of what was for their interest, and ought to be under no external
      controul whatever. The two branches would produce a sufficient controul
      within the Legislature itself.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason observed that a vote had already passed he found [he was out at
      the time] for vesting the executive powers in a single person. Among these
      powers was that of appointing to offices in certain cases. The probable
      abuses of a negative had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page73" id="page73"></a>[pg&nbsp;73]</span>
      been well explained by D<sup>r</sup> F. as proved by experience, the best
      of all tests. Will not the same door be opened here. The Executive may
      refuse its assent to necessary measures till new appointments shall be
      referred to him; and having by degrees engrossed these into all his own
      hands, the American Executive, like the British, will by bribery &amp;
      influence, save himself the trouble &amp; odium of exerting his negative
      afterwards. We are M<sup>r</sup> Chairman going very far in this business.
      We are not indeed constituting a British Government, but a more dangerous
      monarchy, an elective one. We are introducing a new principle into our
      system, and not necessary as in the British Gov<sup>t</sup> where the
      Executive has greater rights to defend. Do gentlemen mean to pave the way
      to hereditary Monarchy? Do they flatter themselves that the people will
      ever consent to such an innovation? If they do I venture to tell them,
      they are mistaken. The people never will consent. And do gentlemen
      consider the danger of delay, and the still greater danger of a rejection,
      not for a moment but forever, of the plan which shall be proposed to them.
      Notwithstanding the oppression &amp; injustice experienced among us from
      democracy; the genius of the people is in favor of it, and the genius of
      the people must be consulted. He could not but consider the federal system
      as in effect dissolved by the appointment of this Convention to devise a
      better one. And do gentlemen look forward to the dangerous interval
      between extinction of an old, and the establishment of a new Governm<sup>t</sup>
      and to the scenes of confusion which may ensue. He hoped that nothing like
      a Monarchy would ever be attempted in this Country. A hatred to its
      oppressions had carried the people through the late Revolution. Will it
      not be eno&#39; to enable the Executive to suspend offensive laws, till
      they shall be coolly revised, and the objections to them overruled <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page74" id="page74"></a>[pg&nbsp;74]</span> by a
      greater majority than was required in the first instance. He never could
      agree to give up all the rights of the people to a single magistrate: If
      more than one had been fixed on, greater powers might have been entrusted
      to the Executive. He hoped this attempt to give such powers would have its
      weight hereafter as an argument for increasing the number of the
      Executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Doc<sup>r</sup> Franklin. A Gentleman from S.&nbsp;C., (M<sup>r</sup>
      Butler) a day or two ago called our attention to the case of the U.
      Netherlands. He wished the gentleman had been a little fuller, and had
      gone back to the original of that Gov<sup>t</sup>. The people being under
      great obligations to the Prince of Orange whose wisdom and bravery had
      saved them, chose him for the Stadtholder. He did very well.
      Inconveniences however were felt from his powers; which growing more &amp;
      more oppressive, they were at length set aside. Still however there was a
      party for the P. of Orange, which descended to his son who excited
      insurrections, spilt a great deal of blood, murdered the de Witts, and got
      the powers revested in the Stadtholder. Afterwards another Prince had
      power to excite insurrections &amp; make the Stadtholdership hereditary.
      And the present Stadth<sup>der</sup> is ready to wade thro&#39; a bloody
      civil war to the establishment of a monarchy. Col. Mason had mentioned the
      circumstance of appointing officers. He knew how that point would be
      managed. No new appointment would be suffered as heretofore in Pens<sup>a</sup>
      unless it be referred to the Executive; so that all profitable offices
      will be at his disposal. The first man put at the helm will be a good one.
      No body knows what sort may come afterwards. The Executive will be always
      increasing here, as elsewhere, till it ends in a Monarchy.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson opposed the appointm<sup>t</sup> of Judges by the
      National Legisl: Experience shewed the impropriety of such appointm<sup>ts</sup>
      by numerous bodies. Intrigue, partiality, and concealment were the
      necessary consequences. A principal reason for unity in the Executive was
      that officers might be appointed by a single, responsible person.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge was by no means disposed to grant so great a power
      to any single person. The people will think we are leaning too much
      towards Monarchy. He was against establishing any national tribunal except
      a single supreme one. The State tribunals are most proper to decide in all
      cases in the first instance.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Doc<sup>r</sup> Franklin observed that two modes of chusing the Judges had
      been mentioned, to wit, by the Legislature and by the Executive. He wished
      such other modes to be suggested as might occur to other gentlemen; it
      being a point of great moment. He would mention one which he had
      understood was practised in Scotland. He then in a brief and entertaining
      manner related a Scotch mode, in which the nomination proceeded from the
      Lawyers, who always selected the ablest of the profession in order to get
      rid of him, and share his practice among themselves. It was here he said
      the interest of the electors to make the best choice, which should always
      be made the case if possible.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Mr. Madison disliked the election of the Judges by the Legislature or any
      numerous body. Besides the danger of intrigue and partiality, many of the
      members were not judges of the requisite qualifications. The Legislative
      talents which were very different from those of a Judge, commonly
      recommended men to the favor of Legislative Assemblies. It was <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page78" id="page78"></a>[pg&nbsp;78]</span> known
      too that the accidental circumstances of presence and absence, of being a
      member or not a member, had a very undue influence on the appointment. On
      the other hand He was not satisfied with referring the appointment to the
      Executive, He rather inclined to give it to the Senatorial branch, as
      numerous eno&#39; to be confided in&mdash;as not so numerous as to be
      governed by the motives of the other branch; and as being sufficiently
      stable and independent to follow their deliberate judgments. He hinted
      this only and moved that the <i>appointment by the Legislature</i> might
      be struck out, &amp; a blank left to be hereafter filled on maturer
      reflection. M<sup>r</sup> Wilson second it. On the question for striking

    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman thought such a popular ratification unnecessary: the
      articles of Confederation providing for changes and alterations with the
      assent of Cong<sup>s</sup> and ratification of State Legislatures.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison thought this provision essential. The articles of
      Confed<sup>n</sup> themselves were defective in this respect, resting in
      many of the States on the Legislative sanction only. Hence in conflicts
      between acts of the States, and of Cong<sup>s</sup> especially where the
      former are of posterior date, and the decision is to be made by State
      tribunals, an uncertainty must necessarily prevail, or rather perhaps a
      certain decision in favor of the State authority. He suggested also that
      as far as the articles of Union were to be considered as a Treaty only of
      a particular sort, among the Governments of Independent States, the
      doctrine might be set up that a breach of any one article, by any of the
      parties, absolved the other parties from the whole obligation. For these
      reasons as well as others he thought it indispensable that the new
      Constitution should be ratified in the most unexceptionable form, and by
      the supreme authority of the people themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry observed that in the Eastern States the Confed<sup>n</sup>
      had been sanctioned by the people themselves. He seemed afraid of
      referring the new system to them. The people in that quarter have at this
      time the wildest ideas of Government in the world. They were for
      abolishing the Senate in Mass<sup>ts</sup> and giving all the other powers
      of Gov<sup>t</sup> to the other branch of the Legislature.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page81" id="page81"></a>[pg&nbsp;81]</span>
      M<sup>r</sup> King supposed that the last article of y<sup>e</sup> Confed<sup>n</sup>
      Rendered the legislature competent to the ratification. The people of the
      Southern States where the federal articles had been ratified by the
      Legislatures only, had since <i>impliedly</i> given their sanction to it.
      He thought notwithstanding that there might be policy in varying the mode.
      A Convention being a single house, the adoption may more easily be carried
      thro&#39; it, than thro&#39; the Legislatures where there are several
      branches. The Legislatures also being to lose power, will be most likely
      to raise objections. The people having already parted with the necessary
      powers it is immaterial to them, by which Government they are possessed,
      provided they be well employed.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson took this occasion to lead the Committee by a train

      defeated by the inconsiderate or selfish opposition of a few States. He
      hoped the provision for ratifying would be put on such a footing as to
      admit of such a partial union, with a door open for the accession of the

      authority, now moved that that part of the clause in the propos. 9. should
      be expunged: arguing that the State tribunals might and ought to be left
      in all cases to decide in the first instance the right of appeal to the
      supreme national tribunal being sufficient to secure the national rights
      &amp; uniformity of Judgm<sup>ts</sup>: that it was making an unnecessary
      encroachment on the jurisdiction of the States and creating unnecessary
      obstacles to their adoption of the new system. Mr. Sherman 2<sup>ded</sup>
      the motion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison observed that unless inferior tribunals were
      dispersed throughout the Republic with <i>final</i> jurisdiction in <i>many</i>
      cases, appeals would be multiplied to a most oppressive degree; that
      besides, an appeal would not in many cases be a remedy. What was to be
      done after improper Verdicts in State tribunals obtained under the biassed
      directions of a dependent Judge, or the local prejudices of an undirected
      jury? To remand the cause for a new trial would answer no purpose. To
      order a new trial at the Supreme bar would oblige the parties to bring up
      their witnesses, tho&#39; ever so distant from the seat of the Court. An
      effective Judiciary establishment commensurate to the legislative
      authority, was essential. A Government without a proper Executive &amp;
      Judiciary would be the mere trunk of a body, without arms or legs to act
      or move.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson opposed the motion on like grounds. He said the
      admiralty jurisdiction ought to be given wholly to the national
      Government, as it related to cases not within the jurisdiction of
      particular states, &amp; to a scene in which controversies with foreigners
      would be most likely to happen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman was in favor of the motion. He dwelt chiefly on the
      supposed expensiveness of having a new set of Courts, when the existing
      State Courts would answer the same purpose.

      words following "that the National Legislature be empowered to institute
      inferior tribunals." They observed that there was a distinction between
      establishing such tribunals absolutely, and giving a discretion to the
      Legislature to establish or not establish them. They repeated the
      necessity of some such provision.

      of election. In England the people will probably lose their liberty from
      the smallness of the proportion having a right of suffrage. Our danger
      arises from the opposite extreme: hence in Mass<sup>ts</sup> the worst men
      get into the Legislature. Several members of that Body had lately been
      convicted of infamous crimes. Men of indigence, ignorance &amp; baseness,

      are superior to the artifices practised. He was not disposed to run into
      extremes. He was as much principled as ever ag<sup>st</sup> aristocracy
      and monarchy. It was necessary on the one hand that the people should
      appoint one branch of the Gov<sup>t</sup> in order to inspire them with
      the necessary confidence. But he wished the election on the other to be so
      modified as to secure more effectually a just preference of merit. His
      idea was that the people should nominate certain persons in certain

      wished that vigorous authority to flow immediately <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page85" id="page85"></a>[pg&nbsp;85]</span> from the legitimate
      source of all authority. The Gov<sup>t</sup> ought to possess not only 1<sup>st</sup>
      the <i>force</i>, but 2<sup>dly</sup> the <i>mind or sense</i> of the
      people at large. The Legislature ought to be the most exact transcript of
      the whole Society. Representation is made necessary only because it is
      impossible for the people to act collectively. The opposition was to be
      expected he said from the <i>Governments</i>, not from the Citizens of the
      States. The latter had parted as was observed (by M<sup>r</sup> King) with
      all the necessary powers; and it was immaterial to them, by whom they were
      exercised, if well exercised. The State officers were to be the losers of
      power. The people he supposed would be rather more attached to the
      national Gov<sup>t</sup> than to the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> as being more
      important in itself, and more flattering to their pride. There is no
      danger of improper elections if made by <i>large</i> districts. Bad
      elections proceed from the smallness of the districts which give an
      opportunity to bad men to intrigue themselves into office.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman. If it were in view to abolish the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>
      the elections ought to be by the people. If the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> are
      to be continued, it is necessary in order to preserve harmony between the
      National &amp; State Gov<sup>ts</sup> that the elections to the former sh<sup>d</sup>
      be made by the latter. The right of participating in the National Gov<sup>t</sup>
      would be sufficiently secured to the people by their election of the State
      Legislatures. The objects of the Union, he thought were few, 1. defence ag<sup>st</sup>
      foreign danger, 2. ag<sup>st</sup> internal disputes &amp; a resort to
      force, 3. Treaties with foreign nations 4. regulating foreign commerce,
      &amp; drawing revenue from it. These &amp; perhaps a few lesser objects
      alone rendered a Confederation of the States necessary. All other matters
      civil &amp; criminal would be much better in the hands of the States. The
      people are more happy in small than in large States. States may indeed be
      too small as Rhode Island, &amp; thereby <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page86" id="page86"></a>[pg&nbsp;86]</span> be too subject to
      faction. Some others were perhaps too large, the powers of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      not being able to pervade them. He was for giving the General Gov<sup>t</sup>
      power to legislate and execute within a defined province.

    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason. Under the existing Confederacy, Cong<sup>s</sup> represent the
      <i>States</i> and not the <i>people</i> of the States: their acts operate
      on the <i>States</i>, not on the individuals. The case will be changed in
      the new plan of Gov<sup>t</sup>. The people will be represented; they
      ought therefore to choose the Representatives. The requisites in actual
      representation are that the Rep<sup>s</sup> should sympathize with their
      constituents; sh<sup>d</sup> think as they think, &amp; feel as they feel;
      and that for these purposes sh<sup>d</sup> even be residents among them.
      Much he s<sup>d</sup> had been alledged ag<sup>st</sup> democratic
      elections. He admitted that much might be said; but it was to be
      considered that no Gov<sup>t</sup> was free from imperfections &amp;
      evils; and that improper elections in many instances were inseparable from
      Republican Gov<sup>ts</sup>. But compare these with the advantage of this
      Form in favor of the rights of the people, in favor of human nature. He
      was persuaded there was a better chance for proper elections by the
      people, if divided into large districts, than by the State Legislatures.
      Paper money had been issued by the latter when the former were against it.
      Was it to be supposed that the State Legislatures then w<sup>d</sup> not
      send to the Nat<sup>l</sup> legislature patrons of such projects, if the
      choice depended on them.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison considered an election of one branch at least of the
      Legislature by the people immediately, as a clear principle of free Gov<sup>t</sup>
      and that this mode under proper regulations had the additional advantage
      of securing better representatives, as well as of avoiding too great an
      agency of the State Governments in the General one. He differed from the
      member from Connecticut (Mr. Sherman) in thinking <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page87" id="page87"></a>[pg&nbsp;87]</span> the objects mentioned to
      be all the principal ones that required a National Gov<sup>t</sup>. Those
      were certainly important and necessary objects; but he combined with them
      the necessity of providing more effectually for the security of private
      rights, and the steady dispensation of Justice. Interferences with these
      were evils which had more perhaps than anything else, produced this
      convention. Was it to be supposed that republican liberty could long exist
      under the abuses of it practised in some of the States. The gentleman (M<sup>r</sup>
      Sherman) had admitted that in a very small State, faction &amp; oppression
      w<sup>d</sup> prevail. It was to be inferred then that wherever these
      prevailed the State was too small. Had they not prevailed in the largest
      as well as the smallest tho&#39; less than in the smallest; and were we
      not thence admonished to enlarge the sphere as far as the nature of the
      Gov<sup>t</sup> would Admit. This was the only defence ag<sup>st</sup> the
      inconveniences of democracy consistent with the democratic form of Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      All civilized Societies would be divided into different Sects, Factions,
      &amp; interests, as they happened to consist of rich &amp; poor, debtors
      &amp; creditors, the landed, the manufacturing, the commercial interests,
      the inhabitants of this district or that district, the followers of this
      political leader or that political leader&mdash;the disciples of this
      religious Sect or that religious Sect. In all cases where a majority are
      united by a common interest or passion, the rights of the minority are in
      danger. What motives are to restrain them? A prudent regard to the maxim
      that honesty is the best policy is found by experience to be as little
      regarded by bodies of men as by individuals. Respect for character is
      always diminished in proportion to the number among whom the blame or
      praise is to be divided. Conscience, the only remaining tie is known to be
      inadequate in individuals: In large numbers, little is to be expected from
      it. Besides, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page88" id="page88"></a>[pg&nbsp;88]</span>
      Religion itself may become a motive to persecution &amp; oppression. These
      observations are verified by the Histories of every country antient &amp;
      modern. In Greece &amp; Rome the rich &amp; poor, the Creditors &amp;
      debtors, as well as the patricians &amp; plebeians alternately oppressed
      each other with equal unmercifulness. What a source of oppression was the
      relation between the parent cities of Rome, Athens &amp; Carthage, &amp;
      their respective provinces; the former possessing the power, &amp; the
      latter being sufficiently distinguished to be separate objects of it? Why
      was America so justly apprehensive of Parliamentary injustice? Because G.
      Britain had a separate interest real or supposed, &amp; if her authority
      had been admitted, could have pursued that interest at our expence. We
      have seen the mere distinction of colour made in the most enlightened
      period of time, a ground of the most oppressive dominion ever exercised by
      man over man. What has been the source of those unjust laws complained of
      among ourselves? Has it not been the real or supposed interest of the
      major number? Debtors have defrauded their creditors. The landed interest
      has borne hard on the mercantile interest. The Holders of one species of
      property have thrown a disproportion of taxes on the holders of another
      species. The lesson we are to draw from the whole is that where a majority
      are united by a common sentiment, and have an opportunity, the rights of
      the minor party become insecure. In a Republican Gov<sup>t</sup> the
      majority if united have always an opportunity. The only remedy is to
      enlarge the sphere, &amp; thereby divide the community into so great a
      number of interests &amp; parties, that in the 1<sup>st</sup> place a
      majority will not be likely at the same moment to have a common interest
      separate from that of the whole or of the minority; and in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      place that in case they sh<sup>d</sup> have such an interest, they may not
      be apt to unite in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page89" id="page89"></a>[pg&nbsp;89]</span>
      pursuit of it. It was incumbent on us then to try this remedy, and with
      that view to frame a republican system on such a scale &amp; in such a
      form as will controul all the evils w<sup>ch</sup> have been experienced.

      M<sup>r</sup> Dickinson considered it essential that one branch of the
      Legislature sh<sup>d</sup> be drawn immediately from the people; and as
      expedient that the other sh<sup>d</sup> be chosen by the Legislatures of
      the States. This combination of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> with the
      national Gov<sup>t</sup> was as politic as it was unavoidable. In the
      formation of the Senate we ought to carry it through such a refining
      process as will assimilate it as nearly as may be to the House of Lords in
      England. He repeated his warm eulogiums on the British Constitution. He
      was for a strong National Gov<sup>t</sup> but for leaving the States a
      considerable agency in the System. The objection ag<sup>st</sup> making
      the former dependent on the latter might be obviated by giving to the
      Senate an authority permanent &amp; irrevocable for three, five or seven
      years. Being thus independent they will check &amp; decide with becoming
      freedom.

      M<sup>r</sup> Read. Too much attachment is betrayed to the State Govern<sup>ts</sup>.
      We must look beyond their continuance. A national Gov<sup>t</sup> must
      soon of necessity swallow all of them up. They will soon be reduced to the
      mere office of electing the National Senate. He was ag<sup>st</sup>
      patching up the old federal System: he hoped the idea w<sup>d</sup> be
      dismissed. It would be like putting new cloth on an old garment. The
      confederation was founded on temporary principles. It cannot last: it can
      not be amended. If we do not establish a good Gov<sup>t</sup> on new
      principles, we must either go to ruin, or have the work to do over again.
      The people at large are wrongly suspected of being averse to a Gen<sup>l</sup>

      General Pinkney wished to have a good National Gov<sup>t</sup> &amp; at
      the same time to leave a considerable share of power in the States. An
      election of either branch by the people scattered as they are in many
      States, particularly in S.&nbsp;Carolina was totally impracticable. He
      differed from gentlemen who thought that a choice by the people w<sup>d</sup>
      be a better guard ag<sup>st</sup> bad measures, than by the Legislatures.
      A majority of the people in S.&nbsp;Carolina were notoriously for
      paper-money as a legal tender; the Legislature had refused to make it a
      legal tender. The reason was that the latter had some sense of character
      and were restrained by that consideration. The State Legislatures also he
      said would be more jealous, &amp; more ready to thwart the National Gov<sup>t</sup>,
      if excluded from a participation in it. The Idea of abolishing these
      Legislatures w<sup>d</sup> never go down.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson would not have spoken again, but for what had fallen
      from Mr. Read; namely, that the idea of preserving the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>
      ought to be abandoned. He saw no incompatibility between the national
      &amp; State Gov<sup>ts</sup> provided the latter were restrained to
      certain local purposes; nor any probability of their being devoured by the

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson moved to reconsider the vote excluding the Judiciary
      from a share in the revision of the laws, and to add after "National
      Executive" the words "with a convenient number of the national Judiciary;"
      remarking the expediency of reinforcing the Executive with the influence
      of that Department.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison 2<sup>ded</sup> the motion. He observed that the
      great difficulty in rendering the Executive competent to its own defence
      arose from the nature of Republican Gov<sup>t</sup> which could not give
      to an individual citizen that settled pre-eminence in the eyes of the
      rest, that weight of property, that personal interest ag<sup>st</sup>
      betraying the national interest, which appertain to an hereditary
      magistrate. In a Republic personal merit alone could be the ground of
      political exaltation, but it would rarely happen that this merit would be
      so pre-eminent as to produce universal acquiescence. The Executive
      Magistrate would be envied &amp; assailed by disappointed competitors: His
      firmness therefore w<sup>d</sup> need support. He would not possess those
      great emoluments from his station, nor that permanent stake in the public
      interest which w<sup>d</sup> place him out of the reach of foreign
      corruption. He would stand in need therefore of being controuled as well
      as supported. An association of the Judges in his revisionary function w<sup>d</sup>
      both double the advantage and diminish the danger. It w<sup>d</sup> also
      enable the Judiciary Department <span class="pagenum"><a name="page92"
      id="page92"></a>[pg&nbsp;92]</span> the better to defend itself ag<sup>st</sup>
      Legislative encroachments. Two objections had been made 1<sup>st</sup>
      that the Judges ought not to be subject to the bias which a participation
      in the making of laws might give in the exposition of them. 2<sup>dly</sup>
      that the Judiciary Departm<sup>t</sup> ought to be separate &amp; distinct
      from the other great Departments. The 1<sup>st</sup> objection had some
      weight; but it was much diminished by reflecting that a small proportion
      of the laws coming in question before a Judge w<sup>d</sup> be such
      wherein he had been consulted; that a small part of this proportion w<sup>d</sup>
      be so ambiguous as to leave room for his prepossessions; and that but a
      few cases w<sup>d</sup> probably arise in the life of a Judge under such
      ambiguous passages. How much good on the other hand w<sup>d</sup> proceed
      from the perspicuity, the conciseness, and the systematic character w<sup>ch</sup>
      the Code of laws w<sup>d</sup> receive from the Judiciary talents. As to
      the 2<sup>d</sup> objection, it either had no weight, or it applied with
      equal weight to the Executive &amp; to the Judiciary revision of the laws.
      The maxim on which the objection was founded required a separation of the
      Executive as well as the Judiciary from the Legislature &amp; from each
      other. There w<sup>d</sup> in truth however be no improper mixture of
      these distinct powers in the present case. In England, whence the maxim
      itself had been drawn, the Executive had an absolute negative on the laws;
      and the Supreme tribunal of Justice (the House of Lords) formed one of the
      other branches of the Legislature. In short whether the object of the
      revisionary power was to restrain the Legislature from encroaching on the
      other co-ordinate Departments, or on the rights of the people at large; or
      from passing laws unwise in their principle, or incorrect in their form,
      the utility of annexing the wisdom and weight of the Judiciary to the
      Executive seemed incontestable.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry thought the Executive, whilst standing <span

      relinquished the idea from a consideration that these could be called on

      opposed to the introduction of the Judges into the business.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason was for giving all possible weight to the revisionary
      institution. The Executive power ought to be well secured ag<sup>st</sup>

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Dickinson had two reasons for his motion. 1, because the
      sense of the States would be better collected through their Governments;
      than immediately from the people at large; 2. because he <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page95" id="page95"></a>[pg&nbsp;95]</span>
      wished the Senate to consist of the most distinguished characters,
      distinguished for their rank in life and their weight of property, and
      bearing as strong a likeness to the British House of Lords as possible;
      and he thought such characters more likely to be selected by the State
      Legislatures, than in any other mode. The greatness of the number was no
      objection with him. He hoped there would be 80 and twice 80. of them. If
      their number should be small, the popular branch could not be balanced by
      them. The legislature of a numerous people ought to be a numerous body.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson, preferred a small number of Senators, but wished
      that each State should have at least one. He suggested 25 as a convenient
      number. The different modes of representation in the different branches,
      will serve as a mutual check.

      branches will rest on different foundations, and dissensions will
      naturally arise between them. He wished the Senate to be elected by the
      people as well as the other branch, the people might be divided into
      proper districts for the purpose &amp; moved to postpone the motion of M<sup>r</sup>

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Read proposed "that the Senate should be appointed by the
      Executive Magistrate out of a proper number of persons to be nominated by
      the individual legislatures." He said he thought it his duty, to speak his
      mind frankly. Gentlemen he hoped would not be alarmed at the idea. Nothing
      short of this approach towards a proper model of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page96" id="page96"></a>[pg&nbsp;96]</span> Government would answer
      the purpose, and he thought it best to come directly to the point at once.&mdash;His
      proposition was not seconded nor supported.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, if the motion (of Mr. Dickinson) should be agreed
      to, we must either depart from the doctrine of proportional
      representation; or admit into the Senate a very large number of members.
      The first is inadmissible, being evidently unjust. The second is
      inexpedient. The use of the Senate is to consist in its proceeding with
      more coolness, with more system, &amp; with more wisdom, than the popular
      branch. Enlarge their number and you communicate to them the vices which
      they are meant to correct. He differed from M<sup>r</sup> D. who thought
      that the additional number would give additional weight to the body. On
      the contrary it appeared to him that their weight would be in an inverse
      ratio to their number. The example of the Roman Tribunes, was applicable.
      They lost their influence and power, in proportion as their number was
      augmented. The reason seemed to be obvious: They were appointed to take
      care of the popular interests &amp; pretensions at Rome, because the
      people by reason of their numbers could not act in concert; were liable to
      fall into factions among themselves, and to become a prey to their
      aristocratic adversaries. The more the representatives of the people
      therefore were multiplied, the more they partook of the infirmities of
      their constituents, the more liable they became to be divided among
      themselves either from their own indiscretions or the artifices of the
      opposite faction, and of course the less capable of fulfilling their
      trust. When the weight of a set of men depends merely on their personal
      characters; the greater the number the greater the weight. When it depends
      on the degree of political authority lodged in them the smaller the number
      the greater the weight. These considerations might <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page97" id="page97"></a>[pg&nbsp;97]</span> perhaps be combined in
      the intended Senate; but the latter was the material one.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry. 4 modes of appointing the Senate have been mentioned.
      1. by the 1<sup>st</sup> branch of the National Legislature. This would
      create a dependance contrary to the end proposed. 2. by the National
      Executive. This is a stride towards monarchy that few will think of. 3. by
      the people. The people have two great interests, the landed interest, and
      the commercial including the stockholders. To draw both branches from the
      people will leave no security to the latter interest; the people being
      Chiefly composed of the landed interest, and erroneously supposing, that
      the other interests are adverse to it. 4. by the Individual Legislatures.
      The elections being carried thro&#39; this refinement, will be most likely
      to provide some check in favor of the Commercial interest ag<sup>st</sup>
      the landed; without which oppression will take place, and no free Gov<sup>t</sup>

      excluded from all agency in the national one, and all power drawn from the
      people at large, the consequence would be that the national Gov<sup>t</sup>
      would move in the same direction as the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> now do, and
      would run into all the same mischiefs. The reform would only unite the 13
      small streams into one great current pursuing the same course without any
      opposition whatever. He adhered to the opinion that the Senate ought to be
      composed of a large number, and that their influence from family weight
      &amp; other causes would be increased thereby. He did not admit that the
      Tribunes lost their weight in proportion as their n<sup>o</sup> was

      reasoning of (M<sup>r</sup> Madison) was good it would prove that the

      he wished to keep them from devouring the national Gov<sup>t</sup>. He was
      not however for extinguishing these planets as was supposed by Mr. D.&mdash;neither
      did he on the other hand, believe that they would warm or enlighten the
      Sun. Within their proper orbits they must still be suffered to act for
      subordinate purposes, for which their existence is made essential by the
      great extent of our Country. He could not comprehend in what manner the
      landed interest w<sup>d</sup> be rendered less predominant in the Senate,
      by an election through the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page99"
      id="page99"></a>[pg&nbsp;99]</span> medium of the Legislatures than by the
      people themselves. If the Legislatures, as was now complained, sacrificed
      the commercial to the landed interest, what reason was there to expect
      such a choice from them as would defeat their own views. He was for an
      election by the people in large districts which w<sup>d</sup> be most
      likely to obtain men of intelligence &amp; uprightness; subdividing the
      districts only for the accommodation of voters.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison could as little comprehend in what manner family
      weight, as desired by M<sup>r</sup> D. would be more certainly conveyed
      into the Senate through elections by the State Legislatures, than in some
      other modes. The true question was in what mode the best choice w<sup>d</sup>
      be made? If an election by the people, or thro&#39; any other channel than
      the State Legislatures promised as uncorrupt &amp; impartial a preference
      of merit, there could surely be no necessity for an appointment by those
      Legislatures. Nor was it apparent that a more useful check would be
      derived thro&#39; that channel than from the people thro&#39; some other.
      The great evils complained of were that the State Legislatures run into
      schemes of paper money &amp;c. whenever solicited by the people, &amp;
      sometimes without even the sanction of the people. Their influence then,
      instead of checking a like propensity in the National Legislature, may be
      expected to promote it. Nothing can be more contradictory than to say that
      the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature with<sup>t</sup> a proper check, will
      follow the example of the State Legislatures, &amp; in the same breath,
      that the State Legislatures are the only proper check.

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman opposed elections by the people in districts, as not
      likely to produce such fit men as elections by the State Legislatures.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry insisted that the commercial &amp; monied interest w<sup>d</sup>
      be more secure in the hands of the State Legislatures, than of the people
      at large. The <span class="pagenum"><a name="page100" id="page100"></a>[pg&nbsp;100]</span>
      former have more sense of character, and will be restrained by that from
      injustice. The people are for paper money when the Legislatures are ag<sup>st</sup>
      it. In Mass<sup>ts</sup> the County Conventions had declared a wish for a
      <i>depreciating</i> paper that w<sup>d</sup> sink itself. Besides, in some
      States there are two Branches in the Legislature, one of which is somewhat
      aristocratic. There w<sup>d</sup> therefore be so far a better chance of
      refinement in the choice. There seemed, he thought to be three powerful
      objections ag<sup>st</sup> elections by districts, 1. it is impracticable;
      the people cannot be brought to one place for the purpose; and whether
      brought to the same place or not, numberless frauds w<sup>d</sup> be
      unavoidable. 2. small States forming part of the same district with a
      large one, or large part of a large one, w<sup>d</sup> have no chance of
      gaining an appointment for its citizens of merit. 3 a new source of
      discord w<sup>d</sup> be opened between different parts of the same
      district.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney thought the 2<sup>d</sup> branch ought to be
      permanent &amp; independent; &amp; that the members of it w<sup>d</sup> be
      rendered more so by receiving their appointment from the State
      Legislatures. This mode w<sup>d</sup> avoid the rivalships &amp;
      discontents incident to the election by districts. He was for dividing the
      States into three classes according to their respective sizes, &amp; for
      allowing to the 1<sup>st</sup> class three members, to the 2<sup>d</sup>
      two, &amp; to the 3<sup>d</sup> one.

      On a reconsideration of the clause giving the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature
      a negative on such laws of the States as might be contrary to the articles
      of Union, or Treaties with foreign nations,
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney moved "that the National Legislature sh<sup>d</sup>
      have authority to negative all laws which they sh<sup>d</sup> judge to be
      improper." He urged that such a universality of the power was
      indispensably necessary to render it effectual; that the States must be
      kept in due subordination to the nation; that if the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page102" id="page102"></a>[pg&nbsp;102]</span> States were left to
      act of themselves in any case, it w<sup>d</sup> be impossible to defend
      the national prerogatives, however extensive they might be on paper; that
      the acts of Congress had been defeated by this means; nor had foreign
      treaties escaped repeated violations: that this universal negative was in
      fact the corner stone of an efficient national Gov<sup>t</sup>; that under
      the British Gov<sup>t</sup> the negative of the Crown had been found
      beneficial, and the <i>States</i> are more one nation now, than the <i>Colonies</i>
      were then.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison seconded the motion. He could not but regard an
      indefinite power to negative legislative acts of the States as absolutely
      necessary to a perfect System. Experience had evinced a constant tendency
      in the States to encroach on the federal authority; to violate national
      Treaties; to infringe the rights &amp; interests of each other; to oppress
      the weaker party within their respective jurisdictions. A negative was the
      mildest expedient that could be devised for preventing these mischiefs.
      The existence of such a check would prevent attempts to commit them.
      Should no such precaution be engrafted, the only remedy w<sup>d</sup> lie
      in an appeal to coercion. Was such a remedy eligible? was it practicable?
      Could the national resources, if exerted to the utmost enforce a national
      decree ag<sup>st</sup> Mass<sup>ts</sup> abetted perhaps by several of her
      neighbours? It w<sup>d</sup> not be possible. A small proportion of the
      Community, in a compact situation acting on the defensive, and at one of
      its extremities, might at any time bid defiance to the National authority.
      Any Gov<sup>t</sup> for the U. States formed on the supposed
      practicability of using force ag<sup>st</sup> the unconstitutional
      proceedings of the States, w<sup>d</sup> prove as visionary &amp;
      fallacious as the Gov<sup>t</sup> of Cong<sup>s</sup>. The negative w<sup>d</sup>
      render the use of force unnecessary. The States c<sup>d</sup> of
      themselves pass no operative act, any more than one branch of a
      Legislature where there are two branches, can proceed <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page103" id="page103"></a>[pg&nbsp;103]</span> without the other.
      But in order to give the negative this efficacy, it must extend to all
      cases. A discrimination w<sup>d</sup> only be a fresh source of contention
      between the two authorities. In a word, to recur to the illustrations
      borrowed from the planetary system. This prerogative of the General Gov<sup>t</sup>,
      is the great pervading principle that must controul the centrifugal
      tendency of the States; which, without it, will continually fly out of
      their proper orbits and destroy the order &amp; harmony of the political
      System.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson was ag<sup>st</sup> giving a power that might
      restrain the States from regulating their internal police.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry c<sup>d</sup> not see the extent of such a power, and
      was ag<sup>st</sup> every power that was not necessary. He thought a
      remonstrance ag<sup>st</sup> unreasonable acts of the States w<sup>d</sup>
      reclaim them. If it sh<sup>d</sup> not force might be resorted to. He had
      no objection to authorize a negative to paper money and similar measures.
      When the confederation was depending before Congress, Massachusetts was
      then for inserting the power of emitting paper money am<sup>g</sup> the
      exclusive powers of Congress. He observed that the proposed negative w<sup>d</sup>
      extend to the regulations of the Militia, a matter on which the existence
      of a State might depend. The Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature with such a power
      may enslave the States. Such an idea as this will never be acceded to. It
      has never been suggested or conceived among the people. No speculative
      projector, and there are eno&#39; of that character among us, in politics
      as well as in other things, has in any pamphlet or newspaper thrown out
      the idea. The States too have different interests and are ignorant of each
      other&#39;s interests. The Negative therefore will be abused. New States
      too having separate views from the old States will never come into the
      Union. They may even be under some foreign influence; <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page104" id="page104"></a>[pg&nbsp;104]</span> are they in such case
      to participate in the negative on the will of the other States?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman thought the cases in which the negative ought to be
      exercised, might be defined. He wished the point might not be decided till
      a trial at least sh<sup>d</sup> be made for that purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson would not say what modifications of the proposed
      power might be practicable or expedient. But however novel it might appear
      the principle of it when viewed with a close &amp; steady eye, is right.
      There is no instance in which the laws say that the individual sh<sup>d</sup>
      be bound in one case, &amp; at liberty to judge whether he will obey or
      disobey in another. The cases are parallel. Abuses of the power over the
      individual person may happen as well as over the individual States.
      Federal liberty is to the States, what civil liberty, is to private
      individuals, and States are not more unwilling to purchase it, by the
      necessary concession of their political sovereignty, than the savage is to
      purchase Civil liberty by the surrender of the personal sovereignty, which
      he enjoys in a State of nature. A definition of the cases in which the
      Negative should be exercised, is impracticable. A discretion must be left
      on one side or the other? will it not be most safely lodged on the side of
      the Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>? Among the first sentiments expressed
      in the first Cong<sup>s</sup> one was that Virg<sup>a</sup> is no more,
      that Mass<sup>ts</sup> is no [more], that P<sup>a</sup> is no more &amp;c.
      We are now one nation of brethren. We must bury all local interests &amp;
      distinctions. This language continued for some time. The tables at length
      began to turn. No sooner were the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> formed than their
      jealousy &amp; ambition began to display themselves. Each endeavoured to
      cut a slice from the common loaf, to add to its own morsel, till at length
      the confederation became frittered down to the impotent condition in which
      it now stands. Review the progress of the articles of Confederation <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page105" id="page105"></a>[pg&nbsp;105]</span>
      thro&#39; Congress &amp; compare the first &amp; last draught of it. To
      correct its vices is the business of this convention. One of its vices is
      the want of an effectual controul in the whole over its parts. What danger
      is there that the whole will unnecessarily sacrifice a part? But reverse
      the case, and leave the whole at the mercy of each part, and will not the
      general interest be continually sacrificed to local interests?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Dickenson deemed it impossible to draw a line between the
      cases proper &amp; improper for the exercise of the negative. We must take
      our choice of two things. We must either subject the States to the danger
      of being injured by the power of the Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> or
      the latter to the danger of being injured by that of the States. He
      thought the danger greater from the States. To leave the power doubtful,
      would be opening another spring of discord, and he was for shutting as
      many of them as possible.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Bedford, in answer to his colleague&#39;s question, where w<sup>d</sup>
      be the danger to the States from this power, would refer him to the
      smallness of his own State which may be injured at pleasure without
      redress. It was meant he found to strip the small States of their equal
      right of suffrage. In this case Delaware would have about 1/90 for its
      share in the General Councils, whilst P<sup>a</sup> &amp; V<sup>a</sup>
      would possess 1/3 of the whole. Is there no difference of interests, no
      rivalship of commerce, of manufactures? Will not these large States crush
      the small ones whenever they stand in the way of their ambitious or
      interested views. This shews the impossibility of adopting such a system
      as that on the table, or any other founded on a change in the priñple of
      representation. And after all, if a State does not obey the law of the new
      System, must not force be resorted to as the only ultimate remedy, in this
      as in any other system. It seems as if P<sup>a</sup> &amp; V<sup>a</sup>
      by the conduct of their deputies wished to <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page106" id="page106"></a>[pg&nbsp;106]</span> provide a system in
      which they would have an enormous &amp; monstrous influence. Besides, How
      can it be thought that the proposed negative can be exercised? Are the
      laws of the States to be suspended in the most urgent cases until they can
      be sent seven or eight hundred miles, and undergo the deliberation of a
      body who may be incapable of Judging of them? Is the National Legislature
      too to sit continually in order to revise the laws of the States?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison observed that the difficulties which had been
      started were worthy of attention and ought to be answered before the
      question was put. The case of laws of urgent necessity must be provided
      for by some emanation of the power from the Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      into each State so far as to give a temporary assent at least. This was
      the practice in the Royal Colonies before the Revolution and would not
      have been inconvenient if the supreme power of negativing had been
      faithful to the American interest, and had possessed the necessary
      information. He supposed that the negative might be very properly lodged
      in the senate alone, and that the more numerous &amp; expensive branch
      therefore might not be obliged to sit constantly. He asked M<sup>r</sup>
      B. what would be the consequence to the small States of a dissolution of
      the Union w<sup>ch</sup> seemed likely to happen if no effectual
      substitute was made for the defective System existing, and he did not
      conceive any effectual system could be substituted on any other basis than
      that of a proportional suffrage? If the large States possessed the Avarice
      &amp; ambition with which they were charged, would the small ones in their
      neighbourhood, be more secure when all controul of a Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      was withdrawn.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler was vehement ag<sup>st</sup> the Negative in the

            "The debates and proceedings of the Convention are kept in profound

            can only be formed from the prevailing impressions of men of
            reflection and understanding&mdash;these are reducible to two
            schemes&mdash;the first, a consolidation of the whole Empire into
            one republic, leaving in the States nothing more than subordinate
            courts for facilitating the administration of the Laws&mdash;the
            second an investiture of the f&oelig;deral sovereignty with full and
            independent authority as to the Trade, Revenues, and forces of the

          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            The first idea, I apprehend, would be impracticable, and therefore
            do not suppose it can be adopted&mdash;general Laws through a
            Country embracing so many climates, productions, and manners as the
            United States, would operate many oppressions &amp; a general
            legislature would be found incompetent to the formation of local
            ones, as a majority would in every instance, be ignorant of, and
            unaffected by the objects of legislation.... Something like the
            second will probably be formed&mdash;indeed I am certain that
            nothing less than what will give the f&oelig;deral sovereignty a
            compleat controul over the state Governments, will be thought worthy
            of discussion&mdash;such a scheme constructed upon well adjusted
            principles would certainly give us stability and importance as a
            nation, and if the Executive powers can be sufficiently checked,
            must be eligible&mdash;unless the whole has a decided influence over
            the parts, the constant effort will be to resume the delegated
            powers, and there cannot be an inducement in the f&oelig;deral
            sovereignty to refuse its assent to an innocent act of a State....
            The Eastern opinions are for a total surrender of the state
            Sovereignties, and indeed some amongst them go to a monarchy at once&mdash;they

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry, according to previous notice given by him, moved
      "that the national Executive should <span class="pagenum"><a name="page108"
      id="page108"></a>[pg&nbsp;108]</span> be elected by the Executives of the
      States whose proportion of votes should be the same with that allowed to
      the States in the election of the Senate." If the appointm<sup>t</sup>
      should be made by the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature, it would lessen that
      independence of the Executive which ought to prevail, would give birth to
      intrigue and corruption between the Executive &amp; Legislature previous
      to the election, and to partiality in the Executive afterwards to the
      friends who promoted him. Some other mode therefore appeared to him
      necessary. He proposed that of appointing by the State Executives as most
      analogous to the principle observed in electing the other branches of the
      Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>; the first branch being chosen by the <i>people</i>
      of the States, &amp; the 2<sup>d</sup> by the Legislatures of the States,
      he did not see any objection ag<sup>st</sup> letting the Executive be
      appointed by the Executives of the States. He supposed the Executives
      would be most likely to select the fittest men, and that it would be their
      interest to support the man of their own choice.

      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph urged strongly the inexpediency of M<sup>r</sup>
      Gerry&#39;s mode of appointing the Nat<sup>l</sup> Executive. The
      confidence of the people would not be secured by it to the Nat<sup>l</sup>
      magistrate. The small States would lose all chance of an appointm<sup>t</sup>
      from within themselves. Bad appointments would be made; the Executives of
      the States being little conversant with characters not within their own
      small spheres. The State Executives too notwithstanding their
      constitutional independence, being in fact dependent on the State
      Legislatures will generally be guided by the views of the latter, and
      prefer either favorites within the States, or such as it may be expected
      will be most partial to the interests of the State. A Nat<sup>l</sup>
      Executive thus chosen will not be likely to defend with becoming vigilance
      &amp; firmness the National rights ag<sup>st</sup> State encroachments.
      Vacancies also must happen. How can these be filled? He could not suppose
      either that the Executives would feel the interest in supporting the Nat<sup>l</sup>
      Executive which had been imagined. They will not cherish the great Oak
      which is to reduce them to paltry shrubs.

      that any question on this point was brought into view. It had been much
      agitated in Cong<sup>s</sup> at the time of forming the Confederation, and
      was then rightly settled by allowing to each sovereign State an equal
      vote. Otherwise the smaller States must have been destroyed instead of
      being saved. The substitution of a ratio, he admitted carried fairness on
      the face of it; but on a deeper examination was unfair and unjust. Judging
      of the disparity of the States by the quota of Cong<sup>s</sup>, Virg<sup>a</sup>
      would have 16 votes, and Georgia but one. A like proportion to the others
      will make the whole number ninety. There will be 3 large states, and 10
      small ones. The large States by which he meant Mass<sup>ts</sup> Pen<sup>a</sup>
      &amp; Virg<sup>a</sup> will carry every thing before them. It had been
      admitted, and was known to him from facts within N.&nbsp;Jersey that where
      large &amp; small counties were united into a district for electing
      representatives for the district, the large counties always carried their
      point, and Consequently that the large States would do so. Virg<sup>a</sup>
      with her sixteen votes will be a solid column indeed, a formidable
      phalanx. While Georgia with her Solitary vote, and the other little States
      will be obliged to throw themselves constantly into the scale of some
      large one, in order to have any weight at all. He had come to the
      convention with a view of being as useful as he could in giving energy and
      stability to the federal Government. When the proposition for destroying
      the equality of votes came forward, he was astonished, he was alarmed. Is
      it fair then it will be asked that Georgia should have an equal vote with
      Virg<sup>a</sup>. He would not say it was. What remedy then? One only,
      that a map of the U. S.&nbsp;be spread out, that all the existing
      boundaries be erased, and that a new partition of the whole be made into
      13 equal parts.

      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson considered the proposition for a proportional
      representation as striking at the existence of the lesser States. He w<sup>d</sup>
      premise however to an investigation of this question some remarks on the
      nature structure and powers of the Convention. The Convention he said was
      formed in pursuance of an Act of Cong<sup>s</sup> that this act was
      recited in several of the Commissions, particularly that of Mass<sup>ts</sup>
      which he required to be read: that the amendment of the Confederacy was
      the object of all the laws and Commissions on the subject: that the
      articles of the Confederation were therefore the proper basis of all the
      proceedings of the Convention. We ought to keep within its limits, or we
      should be charged by our Constituents with usurpation, that the people of
      America were sharpsighted and not to be deceived. But the Commissions
      under which we acted were not only the measure of our power, they denoted
      also the sentiments of the States on the subject of our deliberation. The
      idea of a National Gov<sup>t</sup> as contradistinguished from a federal
      one, never entered into the mind of any of them, and to the public mind we
      must accommodate ourselves. We have no power to go beyond the federal
      Scheme, and if we had the people are not ripe for any other. We must
      follow the people; the people will not follow us.&mdash;The <i>proposition</i>
      could not be maintained whether considered in reference to us as a nation,
      or as a confederacy. A confederacy supposes sovereignty in the members
      composing it &amp; sovereignty supposes equality. If we are to be
      considered as a nation, all State distinctions must be abolished, the
      whole must be thrown into hotchpot, and when an equal division is made,
      then there may be fairly an equality of representation. He held up Virg<sup>a</sup>
      Mass<sup>ts</sup> &amp; P<sup>a</sup> as the three large States, and the
      other ten as small ones; repeating the calculations of M<sup>r</sup>
      Brearly, as to the disparity of votes which w<sup>d</sup> take place, and
      affirming <span class="pagenum"><a name="page112" id="page112"></a>[pg&nbsp;112]</span>
      that the small States would never agree to it. He said there was no more
      reason that a great individual State contributing much, should have more
      votes than a small one contributing little, than that a rich individual
      citizen should have more votes than an indigent one. If the rateable
      property of A was to that of B as 40 to 1, ought A for that reason to have
      40 times as many votes as B. Such a principle would never be admitted, and
      if it were admitted would put B entirely at the mercy of A. As A has more
      to be protected than B so he ought to contribute more for the common
      protection. The same may be said of a large State w<sup>ch</sup> has more
      to be protected than a small one. Give the large States an influence in
      proportion to their magnitude, and what will be the consequence? Their
      ambition will be proportionally increased, and the small States will have
      every thing to fear. It was once proposed by Galloway &amp; some others
      that America should be represented in the British Parl<sup>t</sup> and
      then be bound by its laws. America could not have been entitled to more
      than 1/3 of the n<sup>o</sup> of Representatives which would fall to the
      share of G. B. Would American rights &amp; interests have been safe under
      an authority thus constituted? It has been said that if a Nat<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> is to be formed so as to operate on the people, and not on
      the States, the representatives ought to be drawn from the people. But why
      so? May not a Legislature filled by the State Legislatures operate on the
      people who chuse the State Legislatures? or may not a practicable coercion
      be found. He admitted that there was none such in the existing System.&mdash;He
      was attached strongly to the plan of the existing Confederacy, in which
      the people chuse their Legislative representatives; and the Legislatures
      their federal representatives. No other amendments were wanting than to
      mark the orbits of the States with due precision, and provide for the use
      of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page113" id="page113"></a>[pg&nbsp;113]</span>
      coercion, which was the great point. He alluded to the hint thrown out
      heretofore by M<sup>r</sup> Wilson of the necessity to which the large
      States might be reduced of confederating among themselves, by a refusal of
      the others to concur. Let them unite if they please, but let them remember
      that they have no authority to compel the others to unite. N.&nbsp;Jersey
      will never confederate on the plan before the Committee. She would be
      swallowed up. He had rather submit to a monarch, to a despot, than to such
      a fate. He would not only oppose the plan here but on his return home do
      every thing in his power to defeat it there.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson, hoped if the Confederacy should be dissolved, that a
      <i>majority</i>, that a <i>minority</i> of the States would unite for
      their safety. He entered elaborately into the defence of a proportional
      representation, stating for his first position that as all authority was
      derived from the people, equal numbers of people ought to have an equal n<sup>o</sup>
      of representatives, and different numbers of people different numbers of
      representatives. This principle had been improperly violated in the
      Confederation, owing to the urgent circumstances of the time. As to the
      case of A. &amp; B. stated by M<sup>r</sup> Patterson, he observed that in
      districts as large as the States, the number of people was the best
      measure of their comparative wealth. Whether therefore wealth or numbers
      were to form the ratio it would be the same. M<sup>r</sup> P. admitted
      persons, not property to be the measure of suffrage. Are not the Citizens
      of Pen<sup>a</sup> equal to those of N.&nbsp;Jersey? does it require 150
      of the former to balance 50 of the latter? Representatives of different
      districts ought clearly to hold the same proportion to each other, as
      their respective Constituents hold to each other. If the small States will
      not confederate on this plan, Pen<sup>a</sup> &amp; he presumed some other
      States, would not confederate on any other. We have been told that each
      State being sovereign, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page114" id="page114"></a>[pg&nbsp;114]</span>
      all are equal. So each man is naturally a sovereign over himself, and all
      men are therefore naturally equal. Can he retain this equality when he
      becomes a member of Civil Government. He can not. As little can a
      Sovereign State, when it becomes a member of a federal govern<sup>t</sup>.
      If N.&nbsp;J. will not part with her sovereignty it is vain to talk of Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      A new partition of the States is desirable, but evidently &amp; totally
      impracticable.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson illustrated the cases by a comparison of the
      different States, to Counties of different sizes within the same State;
      observing that proportional representation was admitted to be just in the
      latter case, and could not therefore be fairly contested in the former.

        name="page116" id="page116"></a>[pg&nbsp;116]</span> this point, the
        proportion of representation, came before us, our debates were carried
        on with great coolness &amp; temper. If any thing of a contrary kind,
        has on this occasion appeared. I hope it will not be repeated; for we
        are sent here to <i>consult</i>, not to <i>contend</i>, with each other;
        and declarations of a fixed opinion, and of determined resolution, never
        to change it, neither enlighten nor convince us. Positiveness and warmth
        on one side, naturally beget their like on the other; and tend to create
        and augment discord &amp; division in a great concern, wherein harmony
        &amp; Union are extremely necessary to give weight to our Councils, and
        render them effectual in promoting &amp; securing the common good.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        I must own that I was originally of opinion it would be better if every
        member of Congress, or our national Council, were to consider himself
        rather as a representative of the whole, than as an Agent for the
        interests of a particular State; in which case the proportion of members
        for each State would be of less consequence, &amp; it would not be very
        material whether they voted by States or individually. But as I find
        this is not to be expected, I now think the number of Representatives
        should bear some proportion to the number of the Represented; and that
        the decisions sh<sup>d</sup> be by the majority of members, not by the
        majority of the States. This is objected to from an apprehension that
        the greater States would then swallow up the smaller. I do not at
        present clearly see what advantage the greater States could propose to
        themselves by swallowing up the smaller, and therefore do not apprehend
        they would attempt it. I recollect that in the beginning of this
        Century, When the Union was proposed of the two Kingdoms, England &amp;
        Scotland, the Scotch Patriots were full of fears, that unless they had
        an equal number of Representatives in Parliament, they should be ruined
        by the superiority of the English. They finally agreed <span
        class="pagenum"><a name="page117" id="page117"></a>[pg&nbsp;117]</span>
        however that the different proportions of importance in the Union, of
        the two Nations should be attended to, whereby they were to have only
        forty members in the House of Commons, and only sixteen in the House of
        Lords; A very great inferiority of numbers! And yet to this day I do not
        recollect that any thing has been done in the Parliament of Great
        Britain to the prejudice of Scotland; and whoever looks over the lists
        of Public officers, Civil &amp; Military of that nation will find I
        believe that the North Britons enjoy at least their full proportion of
        emolument.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        But, sir, in the present mode of voting by States, it is equally in the
        power of the lesser States to swallow up the greater; and this is
        mathematically demonstrable. Suppose for example, that 7 smaller States
        had each 3 members in the House, and the 6 larger to have one with
        another 6 members; and that upon a question, two members of each smaller
        State should be in the affirmative and one in the Negative, they would

        theirs in the disposition of the greater. An honorable gentleman has, to
        avoid this difficulty, hinted a proposition of <span class="pagenum"><a
        name="page118" id="page118"></a>[pg&nbsp;118]</span> equalizing the
        States. It appears to me an equitable one, and I should, for my own
        part, not be against such a measure, if it might be found practicable.
        Formerly, indeed, when almost every province had a different
        Constitution, some with greater others with fewer privileges, it was of
        importance to the borderers when their boundaries were contested,
        whether by running the division lines, they were placed on one side or
        the other. At present when such differences are done away, it is less
        material. The Interest of a State is made up of the interests of its
        individual members. If they are not injured, the State is not injured.
        Small States are more easily well &amp; happily governed than large
        ones. If therefore in such an equal division, it should be found
        necessary to diminish Pennsylvania, I should not be averse to the giving
        a part of it to N. Jersey, and another to Delaware. But as there would
        probably be considerable difficulties in adjusting such a division; and
        however equally made at first, it would be continually varying by the
        augmentation of inhabitants in some States, and their fixed proportion
        in others; and thence frequent occasion for new divisions, I beg leave
        to propose for the consideration of the Committee another mode, which
        appears to me to be as equitable, more easily carried into practice, and
        more permanent in its nature.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        Let the weakest State say what proportion of money or force it is able
        and willing to furnish for the general purposes of the Union.

        If these joint and equal supplies should on particular occasions not be
        sufficient, Let Congress make requisitions on the richer and more
        powerful States for further aids, to be voluntarily afforded, leaving to
        each State the right of considering the necessity and utility of the aid
        desired, and of giving more or less as it should be found proper.

        This mode is not new. It was formerly practised with success by the
        British Government with respect to Ireland and the Colonies. We
        sometimes gave even more than they expected, or thought just to accept;
        and in the last war carried on while we were united, they gave us back
        in 5 years a million Sterling. We should probably have continued such
        voluntary contributions, whenever the occasions appeared to require them
        for the common good of the Empire. It was not till they chose to force
        us, and to deprive us of the merit and pleasure of voluntary
        contributions that we refused &amp; resisted. Those contributions
        however were to be disposed of at the pleasure of a Government in which
        we had no representative. I am therefore persuaded, that they will not
        be refused to one in which the Representation shall be equal.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry repeated his opinion that it was necessary to consider
      what the people would approve. This had been the policy of all
      Legislators. If the reasoning of Mr. Madison were just, and we supposed a
      limited Monarchy the best form in itself, we ought to recommend it, tho&#39;
      the genius of the people was decidedly adverse to it, and having no
      hereditary distinctions among us, we were destitute of the essential
      materials for such an innovation.

      Col. Mason seconded the motion; adding that it would be improper for other
      reasons to leave the wages to be regulated by the States. 1. the different
      States would make different provision for their representatives, and an
      inequality would be felt among them, whereas he thought they ought to be
      in all respects equal. 2. the parsimony of the States might reduce the
      provision so low that as had already happened in choosing delegates to
      Congress, the question would be not who were most fit to be chosen, but
      who were most willing to serve.

    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman, thought 7 years too long. He grounded his
      opposition he said on the principle that if they did their duty well, they
      would be reelected. And if they acted amiss, an earlier opportunity should
      be allowed for getting rid of them. He preferred 5 years which w<sup>d</sup>
      be between the terms of the 1<sup>st</sup> branch &amp; of the executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pierce proposed 3 years. 7 years would raise an alarm. Great
      mischiefs had arisen in England from their septennial Act which was
      reprobated by most of their patriotic Statesmen.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph was for the term of 7 years. The democratic
      licentiousness of the State Legislatures proved the necessity of a firm
      Senate. The object of this 2<sup>d</sup> branch is to controul the
      democratic branch of the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature. If it be not a firm
      body, the other branch being more numerous, and coming immediately from
      the people, will overwhelm it. The Senate of Maryland constituted on like
      principles had been scarcely able to stem the popular torrent. No mischief
      can be apprehended, as the concurrence of the other branch, and in some
      measure, of the Executive, will in all cases be necessary. A firmness
      &amp; independence may be the more necessary also in this branch, as it
      ought to guard the Constitution ag<sup>st</sup> encroachments of the
      Executive who will be apt to form combinations with the demagogues of the
      popular branch.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, considered 7 years as a term by no means too long.
      What we wished was to give to the Gov<sup>t</sup> that stability which was
      every where called for, and which the Enemies of the Republican form
      alledged to be inconsistent with its nature. He was <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page129" id="page129"></a>[pg&nbsp;129]</span> not afraid of giving
      too much stability by the term of Seven years. His fear was that the
      popular branch would still be too great an overmatch for it. It was to be
      much lamented that we had so little direct experience to guide us. The
      Constitution of Maryland was the only one that bore any analogy to this
      part of the plan. In no instance had the Senate of Mary<sup>d</sup>
      created just suspicions of danger from it. In some instances perhaps it
      may have erred by yielding to the H. of Delegates. In every instance of
      their opposition to the measures of the H. of D. they had had with them
      the suffrages of the most enlightened and impartial people of the other
      States as well as of their own. In the States where the Senates, were
      chosen in the same manner as the other branches, of the Legislature, and
      held their seats for 4 years, the institution was found to be no check
      whatever ag<sup>st</sup> the instabilities of the other branches. He
      conceived it to be of great importance that a stable &amp; firm Gov<sup>t</sup>,
      organized in the republican form should be held out to the people. If this
      be not done, and the people be left to judge of this species of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      by y<sup>e</sup> operations of the defective systems under which they now
      live, it is much to be feared the time is not distant when, in universal
      disgust, they will renounce the blessing which they have purchased at so
      dear a rate, and be ready for any change that may be proposed to them.

      their snares.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler saw no reason for such a discrimination. We were
      always following the British Constitution when the reason of it did not
      apply. There was no analogy between the H. of Lords and the body proposed
      to be established. If the Senate should be degraded by any such
      discriminations, the best men would be apt to decline serving in it in
      favor of the other branch. And it will lead the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page133" id="page133"></a>[pg&nbsp;133]</span> latter into the
      practice of tacking other clauses to money bills.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison observed that the Comentators on the Brit: Const:
      had not yet agreed on the reason of the restriction on the H. of L. in
      money bills. Certain it was there could be no similar reason in the case
      before us. The Senate would be the representatives of the people as well
      as the 1<sup>st</sup> branch. If they s<sup>d</sup> have any dangerous
      influence over it, they would easily prevail on some member of the latter
      to originate the bill they wished to be passed. As the Senate would be
      generally a more capable sett of men, it w<sup>d</sup> be wrong to disable
      them from any preparation of the business, especially of that which was
      most important, and in our republics, worse prepared than any other. The
      Gentleman in pursuance of his principle ought to carry the restraint to
      the <i>amendment</i>, as well as the originating of money bills, since, an
      addition of a given sum w<sup>d</sup> be equivalent to a distinct
      proposition of it.

      M<sup>r</sup> King differed from M<sup>r</sup> Gerry, and concurred in the
      objections to the proposition.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Read favored the proposition, but would not extend the
      restraint to the case of amendments.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney thinks the question premature. If the Senate sh<sup>d</sup>
      be formed on the <i>same</i> proportional representation as it stands at
      present, they s<sup>d</sup> have equal power, otherwise if a different
      principle s<sup>d</sup> be introduced.

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman. As both branches must concur, there can be no
      danger whichever way the Senate be formed. We establish two branches in
      order to get more wisdom, which is particularly needed in the finance
      business&mdash;The Senate bear their share of the taxes, and are also the
      representatives of the people. What a man does by another, he does by
      himself is a maxim. In Con<sup>t</sup> both branches can originate in all
      cases, and it has been found safe &amp; <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page134" id="page134"></a>[pg&nbsp;134]</span> convenient. Whatever
      might have been the reason of the rule as to The H. of Lords, it is clear
      that no good arises from it now even there.

      Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney. This distinction prevails in S. C. and has been a
      source of pernicious disputes between y<sup>e</sup> 2 branches. The
      Constitution is now evaded, by informal schedules of amendments handed
      from y<sup>e</sup> Senate to the other House.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson wishes for a question chiefly to prevent
      re-discussion. The restriction will have one advantage, it will oblige

    <h2>
      <span class="smcap">Saturday June 16. in Committee of the Whole</span> on
      Resolutions propos<sup>d</sup> by M<sup>r</sup> P. &amp; M<sup>r</sup> R.
    </h2>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Lansing called for the reading of the 1<sup>st</sup>
      resolution of each plan, which he considered as involving principles
      directly in contrast; that of M<sup>r</sup> Patterson says he sustains the
      sovereignty of the respective States, that of M<sup>r</sup> Randolph
      destroys it: the latter requires a negative on all the laws of the
      particular States; the former, only certain general powers for the general
      good. The plan of M<sup>r</sup> R. in short absorbs all power except what
      may be exercised in the little local matters of the States which are not
      objects worthy of the supreme cognizance. He grounded his preference of M<sup>r</sup>
      P&#39;s plan, chiefly on two objections ag<sup>st</sup> that of M<sup>r</sup>
      R. 1. want of power in the Convention to discuss &amp; propose it. 2. the
      improbability of its being adopted, 1. He was decidedly of opinion that
      the power of the Convention was restrained to amendments of a federal
      nature, and having for their basis the Confederacy in being. The Act of
      Congress The tenor of the Acts of the States, the Com&#771;issions
      produced by the several deputations all proved this. And this limitation
      of the power to an amendment of the Confederacy, marked the opinion of the
      States, that it was unnecessary &amp; improper to go farther. He was sure
      that this was the case with his State. N.&nbsp;York would never have
      concurred in sending deputies to the Convention, if she had supposed the
      deliberations were to turn on a consolidation of the States, and a
      National Government.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      2. was it probable that the States would adopt &amp; ratify a scheme,
      which they had never authorized us to propose? and which so far exceeded
      what <span class="pagenum"><a name="page144" id="page144"></a>[pg&nbsp;144]</span>
      they regarded as sufficient? We see by their several Acts particularly in
      relation to the plan of revenue proposed by Cong. in 1783, not authorized
      by the Articles of Confederation, what were the ideas they then
      entertained. Can so great a change be supposed to have already taken
      place. To rely on any change which is hereafter to take place in the
      sentiments of the people would be trusting to too great an uncertainty. We
      know only what their present sentiments are. And it is in vain to propose
      what will not accord with these. The States will never feel a sufficient
      confidence in a general Government to give it a negative on their laws.
      The Scheme is itself totally novel. There is no parallel to it to be
      found. The Authority of Congress is familiar to the people, and an
      augmentation of the powers of Congress will be readily approved by them.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson, said as he had on a former occasion given his
      sentiments on the plan proposed by M<sup>r</sup> R. he would now avoiding
      repetition as much as possible give his reasons in favor of that proposed
      by himself. He preferred it because it accorded 1. with the powers of the
      Convention, 2 with the sentiments of the people. If the confederacy was
      radically wrong, let us return to our States, and obtain larger powers,
      not assume them ourselves. I came here not to speak my own sentiments, but
      the sentiments of those who sent me. Our object is not such a Governm<sup>t</sup>
      as may be best in itself, but such a one as our Constituents have
      authorized us to prepare, and as they will approve. If we argue the matter
      on the supposition that no Confederacy at present exists, it can not be
      denied that all the States stand on the footing of equal sovereignty. All
      therefore must concur before any can be bound. If a proportional
      representation be right, why do we not vote so here? If we argue on the
      fact that a federal compact actually exists, and consult the articles of
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page145" id="page145"></a>[pg&nbsp;145]</span>
      it we still find an equal Sovereignty to be the basis of it. He reads the
      5<sup>th</sup> art: of Confederation giving each State a vote&mdash;&amp;
      the 13<sup>th</sup> declaring that no alteration shall be made without
      unanimous consent. This is the nature of all treaties. What is unanimously
      done, must be unanimously undone. It was observed (by M<sup>r</sup>
      Wilson) that the larger State gave up the point, not because it was right,
      but because the circumstances of the moment urged the concession. Be it
      so. Are they for that reason at liberty to take it back. Can the donor
      resume his gift without the consent of the donee. This doctrine may be
      convenient, but it is a doctrine that will sacrifice the lesser States.
      The larger States acceded readily to the confederacy. It was the small
      ones that came in reluctantly and slowly. N. Jersey &amp; Maryland were
      the two last, the former objecting to the want of power in Congress over
      trade: both of them to the want of power to appropriate the vacant
      territory to the benefit of the whole.&mdash;If the sovereignty of the
      States is to be maintained, the Representatives must be drawn immediately
      from the States, not from the people: and we have no power to vary the
      idea of equal sovereignty. The only expedient that will cure the
      difficulty, is that of throwing the States into Hotchpot. To say that this
      is impracticable, will not make it so. Let it be tried, and we shall see
      whether the Citizens of Mass<sup>ts</sup> Pen<sup>a</sup> &amp; V<sup>a</sup>
      accede to it. It will be objected that Coercion will be impracticable. But
      will it be more so in one plan than the other? Its efficacy will depend on
      the quantum of power collected, not on its being drawn from the States, or
      from the individuals; and according to his plan it may be exerted on
      individuals as well as according that of M<sup>r</sup> R. A distinct
      executive &amp; Judiciary also were equally provided by his plan. It is
      urged that two branches in the Legislature are necessary. <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page146" id="page146"></a>[pg&nbsp;146]</span>
      Why? for the purpose of a check. But the reason of the precaution is not
      applicable to this case. Within a particular State, where party heats
      prevail, such a check may be necessary. In such a body as Congress it is
      less necessary, and besides, the delegations of the different States are
      checks on each other. Do the people at large complain of Cong<sup>s</sup>?
      No, what they wish is that Cong<sup>s</sup> may have more power. If the
      power now proposed be not eno&#39;, the people hereafter will make
      additions to it. With proper powers Cong<sup>s</sup> will act with more
      energy &amp; wisdom than the proposed Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature; being
      fewer in number, and more secreted &amp; refined by the mode of election.
      The plan of M<sup>r</sup> R. will also be enormously expensive. Allowing
      Georgia &amp; Del. two representatives each in the popular branch the
      aggregate number of that branch will be 180. Add to it half as many for
      the other branch and you have 270, coming once at least a year from the
      most distant as well as the most central parts of the republic. In the
      present deranged State of our finances can so expensive a System be
      seriously thought of? By enlarging the powers of Cong<sup>s</sup> the
      greatest part of this expence will be saved, and all purposes will be
      answered. At least a trial ought to be made.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson entered into a contrast of the principal points of
      the two plans so far he said as there had been time to examine the one
      last proposed. These points were 1. in the Virg<sup>a</sup> plan there are
      2 &amp; in some degree 3 branches in the Legislature: in the plan from N.&nbsp;J.
      there is to be a <i>single</i> legislature only&mdash;2. Representation of
      the people at large is the basis of one: the State Legislatures, the
      pillars of the other&mdash;3. proportional representation prevails in one;&mdash;equality
      of suffrage in the other&mdash;4. A single Executive Magistrate is at the
      head of the one:&mdash;a plurality is held out in the other.&mdash;5. in
      the one the majority of the people of the U. S.&nbsp;must prevail:&mdash;in
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page147" id="page147"></a>[pg&nbsp;147]</span>
      the other a minority may prevail. 6. the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature is to
      make laws in all cases to which the separate States are incompetent &amp;:&mdash;in
      place of this Cong<sup>s</sup> are to have additional power in a few cases
      only&mdash;7. A negative on the laws of the States:&mdash;in place of this
      coertion to be substituted&mdash;8. The Executive to be removable on
      impeachment &amp; conviction;&mdash;in one plan: in the other to be
      removable at the instance of a majority of the Executives of the States&mdash;9.
      Revision of the laws provided for in one:&mdash;no such check in the other&mdash;10.
      inferior national tribunals in one:&mdash;none such in the other. 11. In
      one y<sup>e</sup> jurisdiction of Nat<sup>l</sup> tribunals to extend
      &amp;c&mdash;; an appellate jurisdiction only allowed in the other. 12.
      Here the jurisdiction is to extend to all cases affecting the Nation<sup>l</sup>
      peace &amp; harmony; <i>there</i> a few cases only are marked out. 13.
      finally y<sup>e</sup> ratification is in this to be by the people
      themselves:&mdash;in that by the legislative authorities according to the
      13 art: of the Confederation.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      With regard to the <i>power of the Convention</i>, he conceived himself
      authorized to <i>conclude nothing</i>, but to be at liberty to <i>propose
      any thing</i>. In this particular he felt himself perfectly indifferent to
      the two plans.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      With <i>regard to the sentiments of the people</i>, he conceived it
      difficult to know precisely what they are. Those of the particular circle
      in which one moved, were commonly mistaken for the general voice. He could
      not persuade himself that the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> &amp; Sovereignties
      were so much the idols of the people, nor a Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      so obnoxious to them, as some supposed. Why s<sup>d</sup> a Nat<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> be unpopular? Has it less dignity? will each Citizen enjoy
      under it less liberty or protection? Will a Citizen of <i>Deleware</i> be
      degraded by becoming a Citizen of the <i>United States</i>? Where do the
      people look at present for relief from the evils of which they complain?
      Is it <span class="pagenum"><a name="page148" id="page148"></a>[pg&nbsp;148]</span>
      from an internal reform of their Gov<sup>ts</sup>? no, Sir. It is from the
      Nat<sup>l</sup> Councils that relief is expected. For these reasons he did
      not fear, that the people would not follow us into a National Gov<sup>t</sup>
      and it will be a further recommendation of M<sup>r</sup> R&#39;<sup>s</sup>
      plan that it is to be submitted to <i>them</i>, and not to the <i>Legislatures</i>,
      for ratification.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Proceeding now to the 1<sup>st</sup> point on which he had contrasted the
      two plans, he observed that anxious as he was for some augmentation of the
      federal powers, it would be with extreme reluctance indeed that he could
      ever consent to give powers to Cong<sup>s</sup> he had two reasons either
      of w<sup>ch</sup> was sufficient, 1. Cong<sup>s</sup> as a Legislative
      body does not stand on the people. 2. it is a <i>single</i> body. 1. He
      would not repeat the remarks he had formerly made on the principles of
      Representation, he would only say that an inequality in it, has ever been
      a poison contaminating every branch of Gov<sup>t</sup>. In G. Britain
      where this poison has had a full operation, the security of private rights
      is owing entirely to the purity of her tribunals of Justice, the Judges of
      which are neither appointed nor paid, by a venal Parliament. The political
      liberty of that Nation, owing to the inequality of representation is at
      the mercy of its rulers. He means not to insinuate that there is any
      parallel between the situation of that Country &amp; ours at present. But
      it is a lesson we ought not to disregard, that the smallest bodies in G.
      B. are notoriously the most corrupt. Every other source of influence must
      also be stronger in small than large bodies of men. When Lord Chesterfield
      had told us that one of the Dutch provinces had been seduced into the
      views of France, he need not have added, that it was not Holland, but one
      of the <i>smallest</i> of them. There are facts among ourselves which are
      known to all. Passing over others, he will only remark that the <i>Impost</i>,
      so anxiously wished for by the public was defeated not <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page149" id="page149"></a>[pg&nbsp;149]</span> by
      any of the <i>larger</i> States in the Union. 2. <i>Congress is a single
      Legislature.</i> Despotism comes on Mankind in different Shapes, sometimes
      in an Executive, sometimes in a Military, one. Is there no danger of a
      Legislative despotism? Theory &amp; practice both proclaim it. If the
      Legislative authority be not restrained, there can be neither liberty nor
      stability; and it can only be restrained by dividing it within itself,
      into distinct and independent branches. In a single House there is no
      check, but the inadequate one, of the virtue &amp; good sense of those who
      compose it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      On another great point, the contrast was equally favorable to the plan
      reported by the Committee of the whole. It vested the Executive powers in
      a single Magistrate. The plan of N.&nbsp;Jersey, vested them in a
      plurality. In order to controul the Legislative authority, you must divide
      it. In order to controul the Executive you must unite it. One man will be
      more responsible than three. Three will contend among themselves till one
      becomes the master of his colleagues. In the triumvirates of Rome first
      Cæsar, then Augustus, are witnesses of this truth. The Kings of Sparta,
      &amp; the Consuls of Rome prove also the factious consequences of dividing
      the Executive Magistracy. Having already taken up so much time he w<sup>d</sup>
      not he s<sup>d</sup>, proceed to any of the other points. Those on which
      he had dwelt, are sufficient of themselves; and on the decision of them,
      the fate of the others will depend.

      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth proposed as a more distinctive form of collecting
      the mind of the Committee on the subject, "that the Legislative power of
      the U. S. should remain in Cong<sup>s</sup>" This was not seconded, though
      it seemed better calculated for the purpose than the 1<sup>st</sup>
      proposition of M<sup>r</sup> Patterson in place of which Mr. E. wished to
      substitute it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph, was not scrupulous on the point of power. When the
      Salvation of the Republic was at stake, it would be treason to our trust,
      not to propose what we found necessary. He painted in strong colours, the
      imbecility of the existing Confederacy, &amp; the danger of delaying a
      substantial reform. In answer to the objection drawn from the sense of our
      Constituents as denoted by their acts relating to the Convention and the
      objects of their deliberation, he observed that as each State acted
      separately in the case, it would have been indecent for it to have charged
      the existing Constitution with all the vices which it might have perceived
      in it. The first State that set on foot this experiment would not have
      been justified in going so far, ignorant as it was of the opinion of
      others, and sensible as it must have been of the uncertainty of a
      successful issue to the experiment. There are certainly reasons of a
      peculiar nature where the ordinary cautions must be dispensed with; and
      this is certainly one of them. He w<sup>d</sup> not as far as depended on
      him leave any thing that seemed necessary, undone. The present moment is
      favorable, and is probably the last that will offer.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The true question is whether we shall adhere to the federal plan, or
      introduce the national plan. The insufficiency of the former has been
      fully displayed by the trial already made. There are but two modes, by
      which the end of a Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> can be attained: the 1<sup>st</sup>
      is by coercion as proposed by M<sup>r</sup> P&#39;s plan 2. by real
      legislation as prop<sup>d</sup> by the other <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page151" id="page151"></a>[pg&nbsp;151]</span> plan. Coercion he
      pronounced to be <i>impracticable</i>, <i>expensive</i>, <i>cruel to
      individuals</i>. It tended also to habituate the instruments of it to shed
      the blood &amp; riot in the Spoils of their fellow Citizens, and
      consequently trained them up for the service of Ambition. We must resort
      therefore to a National <i>Legislation over individuals</i>, for which
      Cong<sup>s</sup> are unfit. To vest such power in them, would be blending
      the Legislative with the Executive, contrary to the rec<sup>d</sup> maxim
      on this subject: If the Union of these powers heretofore in Cong<sup>s</sup>
      has been safe, it has been owing to the general impotency of that body.
      Cong<sup>s</sup> are moreover not elected by the people, but by the
      Legislatures who retain even a power of recall. They have therefore no
      will of their own, they are a mere diplomatic body, and are always
      obsequious to the views of the States, who are always encroaching on the
      authority of the U. States. A provision for harmony among the States, as
      in trade, naturalization &amp;.&mdash;for crushing rebellion whenever it
      may rear its crest&mdash;and for certain other general benefits, must be
      made. The powers for these purposes can never be given to a body,
      inadequate as Congress are in point of representation, elected in the mode
      in which they are, and possessing no more confidence than they do: for
      notwithstanding what has been said to the contrary, his own experience
      satisfied him that a rooted distrust of Congress pretty generally
      prevailed. A Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> alone, properly constituted,
      will answer the purpose; and he begged it to be considered that the
      present is the last moment for establing one. After this select experiment,
      the people will yield to despair.

      Mr. Hamilton,<a name="FNanchor_88_88" id="FNanchor_88_88"></a><a
      href="#Footnote_88_88" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> had been hitherto silent
      on the business before the Convention, partly from respect to others whose
      superior abilities age &amp; experience rendered him unwilling to bring
      forward ideas dissimilar to theirs, and partly from his delicate situation
      with respect to his own State, to whose sentiments as expressed by his
      Colleages, he could by no means accede. This crisis however which now
      marked our affairs, was too serious to permit any scruples whatever to
      prevail over the duty imposed on every man to contribute his efforts for
      the public safety &amp; happiness. He was obliged therefore to declare
      himself unfriendly to both plans. He was particularly opposed to that from
      N.&nbsp;Jersey, being fully convinced, that no amendment of the
      Confederation, leaving the States in possession of their Sovereignty could
      possibly answer the purpose. On the other hand he confessed he was much
      discouraged by the amazing extent of Country in expecting the desired
      blessings from any general sovereignty that could be substituted.&mdash;As
      to the powers of the Convention, he thought the doubts started on that
      subject had arisen from distinctions &amp; reasonings too subtle. A <i>federal</i>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> he conceived to mean an association of independent
      Communities into one. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page153" id="page153"></a>[pg&nbsp;153]</span>
      Different Confederacies have different powers, and exercise them in
      different ways. In some instances the powers are exercised over collective
      bodies; in others over individuals, as in the German Diet&mdash;&amp;
      among ourselves in cases of piracy. Great latitude therefore must be given
      to the signification of the term. The plan last proposed departs itself
      from the <i>federal</i> idea, as understood by some, since it is to
      operate eventually on individuals. He agreed moreover with the Honble
      gentleman from V<sup>a</sup> (M<sup>r</sup> R.) that we owed it to our
      Country, to do on this emergency whatever we should deem essential to its
      happiness. The States sent us here to provide for the exigencies of the
      Union. To rely on &amp; propose any plan not adequate to these exigencies,
      merely because it was not clearly within our powers, would be to sacrifice
      the means to the end. It may be said that the <i>States</i> cannot <i>ratify</i>
      a plan not within the purview of the article of the Confederation
      providing for alterations &amp; amendments. But may not the States
      themselves in which no constitutional authority equal to this purpose
      exists in the Legislatures, have had in view a reference to the people at
      large. In the Senate of N.&nbsp;York, a proviso was moved, that no act of
      the Convention should be binding untill it should be referred to the
      people &amp; ratified; and the motion was lost by a single voice only, the
      reason assigned ag<sup>st</sup> it being, that it might possibly be found
      an inconvenient shackle.

      The great question is what provision shall we make for the happiness of
      our Country? He would first make a comparative examination of the two
      plans&mdash;prove that there were essential defects in both&mdash;and
      point out such changes as might render a <i>national one</i>, efficacious.&mdash;The
      great &amp; essential principles necessary for the support of Government
      are 1. an active &amp; constant interest in supporting it. This principle
      does not exist in the States in favor <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page154" id="page154"></a>[pg&nbsp;154]</span> of the federal Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      They have evidently in a high degree, the esprit de corps. They constantly
      pursue internal interests adverse to those of the whole. They have their
      particular debts&mdash;their particular plans of finance &amp;c. All these
      when opposed to, invariably prevail over the requisitions &amp; plans of
      Congress. 2. The love of power. Men love power. The same remarks are
      applicable to this principle. The States have constantly shewn a
      disposition rather to regain the powers delegated by them than to part
      with more, or to give effect to what they had parted with. The ambition of
      their demagogues is known to hate the controul of the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Government. It may be remarked too that the Citizens have not that anxiety
      to prevent a dissolution of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> as of the
      particular Gov<sup>ts</sup>. A dissolution of the latter would be fatal;
      of the former would still leave the purposes of Gov<sup>t</sup> attainable
      to a considerable degree. Consider what such a State as Virg<sup>a</sup>
      will be in a few years, a few compared with the life of nations. How
      strongly will it feel its importance and self-sufficiency? 3. An habitual
      attachment of the people. The whole force of this tie is on the side of
      the State Gov<sup>t</sup>. Its sovereignty is immediately before the eyes
      of the people: its protection is immediately enjoyed by them. From its
      hand distributive justice, and all those acts which familiarize &amp;
      endear a Gov<sup>t</sup> to a people, are dispensed to them. 4. <i>Force</i>
      by which may be understood a <i>coercion of laws</i> or <i>coercion of
      arms</i>. Cong<sup>s</sup> have not the former except in few cases. In
      particular States, this Coercion is nearly sufficient; tho&#39; he held it
      in most cases, not entirely so. A certain portion of military force is
      absolutely necessary in large communities. Mass<sup>ts</sup> is now
      feeling this necessity &amp; making provision for it. But how can this
      force be exerted on the States collectively. It is impossible. It amounts
      to a war between the parties. Foreign powers also <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page155" id="page155"></a>[pg&nbsp;155]</span> will not be idle
      spectators. They will interpose, the confusion will increase, and a
      dissolution of the Union will ensue. 5. <i>Influence. </i> he did not mean
      corruption, but a dispensation of those regular honors &amp; emoluments,
      which produce an attachment to the Gov<sup>t</sup>. Almost all the weight
      of these is on the side of the States; and must continue so as long as the
      States continue to exist. All the passions then we see, of avarice,
      ambition, interest, which govern most individuals, and all public bodies,
      fall into the current of the States, and do not flow into the stream of
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>. The former therefore will generally
      be an overmatch for the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> and render any
      confederacy, in its very nature precarious. Theory is in this case fully
      confirmed by experience. The Amphyctionic Council had it would seem ample
      powers for general purposes. It had in particular the power of fining and
      using force ag<sup>st</sup> delinquent members. What was the consequence.
      Their decrees were mere signals of war. The Phocian war is a striking
      example of it. Philip at length taking advantage of their disunion, and
      insinuating himself into their councils, made himself master of their
      fortunes. The German Confederacy affords another lesson. The Authority of
      Charlemagne seemed to be as great as could be necessary. The great feudal
      chiefs however, exercising their local sovereignties, soon felt the spirit
      &amp; found the means of, encroachments, which reduced the imperial
      authority to a nominal sovereignty. The Diet has succeeded, which tho&#39;
      aided by a Prince at its head, of great authority independently of his
      imperial attributes, is a striking illustration of the weakness of
      Confederated Governments. Other examples instruct us in the same truth.
      The Swiss cantons have scarce any union at all, and have been more than
      once at war with one another.&mdash;How then are all these evils to be
      avoided? only by such a compleat sovereignty in <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page156" id="page156"></a>[pg&nbsp;156]</span> the General Goverm<sup>t</sup>
      as will turn all the strong principles &amp; passions abovementioned on
      its side. Does the scheme of N.&nbsp;Jersey produce this effect? does it
      afford any substantial remedy whatever? On the contrary it labors under
      great defects, and the defect of some of its provisions will destroy the
      efficacy of others. It gives a direct revenue to Cong<sup>s</sup> but this
      will not be sufficient. The balance can only be supplied by requisitions:
      which experience proves cannot be relied on. If States are to deliberate
      on the mode, they will also deliberate on the object of the supplies, and
      will grant or not grant as they approve or disapprove of it. The
      delinquency of one will invite and countenance it in others. Quotas too
      must in the nature of things be so unequal as to produce the same evil. To
      what standard will you resort? Land is a fallacious one. Compare Holland
      with Russia; France or Eng<sup>d</sup> with other countries of Europe, Pen<sup>a</sup>
      with N.&nbsp;Carol<sup>a</sup> will the relative pecuniary abilities in
      those instances, correspond with the relative value of land. Take numbers
      of inhabitants for the rule and make like comparison of different
      countries, and you will find it to be equally unjust. The different
      degrees of industry and improvement in different Countries render the
      first object a precarious measure of wealth. Much depends too on <i>situation</i>.
      Con<sup>t</sup> N.&nbsp;Jersey &amp; N. Carolina, not being commercial
      States &amp; contributing to the wealth of the Commercial ones, can never
      bear quotas assessed by the ordinary rules of proportion. They will &amp;
      must fail in their duty, their example will be followed, and the union
      itself be dissolved. Whence then is the national revenue to be drawn? from
      Commerce; even from exports which notwithstanding the com&#771;on opinion
      are fit objects of moderate taxation, from excise, &amp;c &amp;c. These
      tho&#39; not equal, are less unequal than quotas. Another destructive
      ingredient in the plan, is that <span class="pagenum"><a name="page157"
      id="page157"></a>[pg&nbsp;157]</span> equality of suffrage which is so
      much desired by the small States. It is not in human nature that V<sup>a</sup>
      &amp; the large States should consent to it, or if they did that they sh<sup>d</sup>
      long abide by it. It shocks too much all ideas of Justice, and every human
      feeling. Bad principles in a Gov<sup>t</sup> tho slow are sure in their
      operation, and will gradually destroy it. A doubt has been raised whether
      Cong<sup>s</sup> at present have a right to keep Ships or troops in time
      of peace. He leans to the negative. Mr. P&#39;<sup>s</sup> plan provides
      no remedy.&mdash;If the powers proposed were adequate, the organization of
      Cong<sup>s</sup> is such that they could never be properly &amp;
      effectually exercised. The members of Cong<sup>s</sup> being chosen by the
      States &amp; subject to recall, represent all the local prejudices. Should
      the powers be found effectual, they will from time to time be heaped on
      them, till a tyrannic sway shall be established. The general power
      whatever be its form if it preserves itself, must swallow up the State
      powers. Otherwise it will be swallowed up by them. It is ag<sup>st</sup>
      all the principles of a good Government to vest the requisite powers in
      such a body as Cong<sup>s</sup>. Two Sovereignties can not co-exist within
      the same limits. Giving powers to Cong<sup>s</sup> must eventuate in a bad
      Gov<sup>t</sup> or in no Gov<sup>t</sup>. The plan of N.&nbsp;Jersey
      therefore will not do. What then is to be done? Here he was embarrassed.
      The extent of the Country to be governed, discouraged him. The expence of
      a general Gov<sup>t</sup> was also formidable; unless there were such a
      diminution of expence on the side of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> as the
      case would admit. If they were extinguished, he was persuaded that great
      &oelig;conomy might be obtained by substituting a general Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      He did not mean however to shock the public opinion by proposing such a
      measure. On the other hand he saw no <i>other</i> necessity for declining
      it. They are not necessary for any of the great purposes of commerce,
      revenue, or agriculture. Subordinate <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page158" id="page158"></a>[pg&nbsp;158]</span> authorities he was
      aware would be necessary. There must be district tribunals; corporations
      for local purposes. But cui bono, the vast &amp; expensive apparatus now
      appertaining to the States. The only difficulty of a serious nature which
      occurred to him, was that of drawing representatives from the extremes to
      the centre of the Community. What inducements can be offered that will
      suffice? The moderate wages for the 1<sup>st</sup> branch would only be a
      bait to little demagogues. Three dollars or thereabouts he supposed would
      be the utmost. The Senate he feared from a similar cause, would be filled
      by certain undertakers who wish for particular offices under the Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      This view of the subject almost led him to despair that a Republican Gov<sup>t</sup>
      could be established over so great an extent. He was sensible at the same
      time that it would be unwise to propose one of any other form. In his
      private opinion he had no scruple in declaring, supported as he was by the
      opinion of so many of the wise &amp; good, that the British Gov<sup>t</sup>
      was the best in the world: and that he doubted much whether any thing
      short of it would do in America. He hoped Gentlemen of different opinions
      would bear with him in this, and begged them to recollect the change of
      opinion on this subject which had taken place and was still going on. It
      was once thought that the power of Cong<sup>s</sup> was amply sufficient
      to secure the end of their institution. The error was now seen by every
      one. The members most tenacious of republicanism, he observed, were as
      loud as any in declaiming ag<sup>st</sup> the vices of democracy. This
      progress of the public mind led him to anticipate the time, when others as
      well as himself would join in the praise bestowed by M<sup>r</sup> Neckar
      on the British Constitution, namely, that it is the only Gov<sup>t</sup>
      in the world "which unites public strength with individual security."&mdash;In
      every Com&#771;unity where industry is encouraged, there will be a <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page159" id="page159"></a>[pg&nbsp;159]</span>
      division of it into the few &amp; the many. Hence separate interests will
      arise. There will be debtors &amp; Creditors &amp;c. Give all power to the
      many, they will oppress the few. Give all power to the few, they will
      oppress the many. Both therefore ought to have the power, that each may
      defend itself ag<sup>st</sup> the other. To the want of this check we owe
      our paper money, instalment laws &amp;c. To the proper adjustment of it
      the British owe the excellence of their Constitution. Their house of Lords
      is a most noble institution. Having nothing to hope for by a change, and a
      sufficient interest by means of their property, in being faithful to the
      national interest, they form a permanent barrier ag<sup>st</sup> every
      pernicious innovation, whether attempted on the part of the Crown or of
      the Commons. No temporary Senate will have firmness eno&#39; to answer the
      purpose. The Senate (of Maryland) which seems to be so much appealed to,
      has not yet been sufficiently tried. Had the people been unanimous &amp;
      eager in the late appeal to them on the subject of a paper emission they
      would have yielded to the torrent. Their acquiescing in such an appeal is
      a proof of it.&mdash;Gentlemen differ in their opinions concerning the
      necessary checks, from the different estimates they form of the human
      passions. They suppose seven years a sufficient period to give the senate
      an adequate firmness, from not duly considering the amazing violence &amp;
      turbulence of the democratic spirit. When a great object of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      is pursued, which seizes the popular passions, they spread like wild fire,
      and become irresistable. He appealed to the gentlemen from the N.&nbsp;England
      States whether experience had not there verified the remark.&mdash;As to
      the Executive, it seemed to be admitted that no good one could be
      established on Republican Principles. Was not this giving up the merits of
      the question; for can there be a good Gov<sup>t</sup> without a good
      Executive. The English Model <span class="pagenum"><a name="page160"
      id="page160"></a>[pg&nbsp;160]</span> was the only good one on this
      subject. The Hereditary interest of the King was so interwoven with that
      of the Nation, and his personal emoluments so great, that he was placed
      above the danger of being corrupted from abroad&mdash;and at the same time
      was both sufficiently independent and sufficiently controuled, to answer
      the purpose of the institution at home, one of the weak sides of Republics
      was their being liable to foreign influence &amp; corruption. Men of
      little character, acquiring great power become easily the tools of
      intermeddling Neibours. Sweden was a striking instance. The French &amp;
      English had each their parties during the late Revolution which was
      effected by the predominant influence of the former.&mdash;What is the
      inference from all these observations? That we ought to go as far in order
      to attain stability and permanency, as republican principles will admit.
      Let one branch of the Legislature hold their places for life or at least
      during good behaviour. Let the Executive also be for life. He appealed to
      the feelings of the members present whether a term of seven years, would
      induce the sacrifices of private affairs which an acceptance of public
      trust would require, so as to ensure the services of the best Citizens. On
      this plan we should have in the Senate a permanent will, a weighty
      interest, which would answer essential purposes. But is this a Republican
      Gov<sup>t</sup>, it will be asked? Yes if all the Magistrates are
      appointed, and vacancies are filled, by the people, or a process of
      election originating with the people. He was sensible that an Executive
      constituted as he proposed would have in fact but little of the power and
      independence that might be necessary. On the other plan of appointing him
      for 7 years, he thought the Executive ought to have but little power. He
      would be ambitious, with the means of making creatures, and as the object
      of his ambition w<sup>d</sup> be to <i>prolong</i> his power, it <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page161" id="page161"></a>[pg&nbsp;161]</span> is
      probable that in case of a war, he would avail himself of the emergence,
      to evade or refuse a degradation from his place. An Executive for life has
      not this motive for forgetting his fidelity, and will therefore be a safer
      depository of power. It will be objected probably, that such an Executive
      will be an <i>elective Monarch</i>, and will give birth to the tumults
      which characterize that form of Gov<sup>t</sup>. He w<sup>d</sup> reply
      that <i>Monarch</i> is an indefinite term. It marks not either the degree
      or duration of power. If this Executive Magistrate w<sup>d</sup> be a
      monarch for life&mdash;the other prop<sup>d</sup> by the Report from the
      Com&#771;ittee of the whole, w<sup>d</sup> be a monarch for seven years.
      The circumstance of being elective was also applicable to both. It had
      been observed by judicious writers that elective monarchies w<sup>d</sup>
      be the best if they could be guarded ag<sup>st</sup> the <i>tumults</i>
      excited by the ambition and intrigues of competitors. He was not sure that
      tumults were an inseparable evil. He rather thought this character of
      Elective Monarchies had been taken rather from particular cases than from
      general principles. The election of Roman Emperors was made by the <i>Army</i>.
      In <i>Poland</i> the election is made by great rival <i>princes</i> with
      independent power, and ample means, of raising commotions. In the German
      Empire, The appointment is made by the Electors &amp; Princes, who have
      equal motives &amp; means, for exciting cabals &amp; parties. Might not
      such a mode of election be devised among ourselves as will defend the
      community ag<sup>st</sup> these effects in any dangerous degree? Having
      made these observations he would read to the Committee a sketch of a plan
      which he sh<sup>d</sup> prefer to either of those under consideration. He
      was aware that it went beyond the ideas of most members. But will such a
      plan be adopted out of doors? In return he would ask will the people adopt
      the other plan? At present they will adopt neither. But he sees the Union
      dissolving or already dissolved&mdash;he <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page162" id="page162"></a>[pg&nbsp;162]</span> sees evils operating
      in the States which must soon cure the people of their fondness for
      democracies&mdash;he sees that a great progress has been already made
      &amp; is still going on in the public mind. He thinks therefore that the
      people will in time be unshackled from their prejudices; and whenever that
      happens, they will themselves not be satisfied at stopping where the plan
      of M<sup>r</sup> R. w<sup>d</sup> place them, but be ready to go as far at
      least as he proposes. He did not mean to offer the paper he had sketched
      as a proposition to the Committee. It was meant only to give a more
      correct view of his ideas, and to suggest the amendments which he should
      probably propose to the plan of M<sup>r</sup> R. in the proper stages of
      its future discussion. He read his sketch in the words following; to wit
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="indent">
        I. The supreme Legislative power of the United States of America to be

        of the United States with power to pass all laws whatsoever subject to

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison. Much stress has been laid by some <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page168" id="page168"></a>[pg&nbsp;168]</span>
      gentlemen on the want of power in the Convention to propose any other than
      a <i>federal</i> plan. To what had been answered by others, he would only
      add, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page169" id="page169"></a></span> that
      neither of the characteristics attached to a <i>federal</i> plan would
      support this objection. One characteristic, was that in a <i>federal</i>
      Government, the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page170" id="page170"></a></span>
      power was exercised not on the people individually; but on the people <i>collectively</i>,
      on the <i>States</i>. Yet in some instances as in piracies, captures &amp;c.
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page171" id="page171"></a></span>
      existing Confederacy, and in many instances the amendments to it proposed
      by M<sup>r</sup> Patterson, must operate immediately on individuals. The
      other <span class="pagenum"><a name="page172" id="page172"></a></span>
      characteristic was, that a <i>federal</i> Gov<sup>t</sup> derived its
      appointments not immediately from the people, but from the States which
      they respectively composed. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page173"
      id="page173"></a></span> Here too were facts on the other side. In two of
      the States, Connect<sup>t</sup> &amp; Rh. Island, the delegates to Cong<sup>s</sup>
      were chosen, not by the Legislatures, but by the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page174" id="page174"></a></span> people at large; and the plan of M<sup>r</sup>
      P. intended no change in this particular.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      It had been alledged (by M<sup>r</sup> Patterson), that the Confederation
      having been formed by unanimous <span class="pagenum"><a name="page175"
      id="page175"></a>[pg&nbsp;175]</span> consent, could be dissolved by
      unanimous Consent only. Does this doctrine result from the nature of
      compacts? does it arise from any particular stipulation in the articles of
      Confederation? If we consider <span class="pagenum"><a name="page176"
      id="page176"></a>[pg&nbsp;176]</span> the federal Union as analagous to
      the fundamental compact by which individuals compose one Society, and
      which must in its theoretic origin at least, have been the unanimous act
      of the component members, it cannot be said that no dissolution of the
      compact can be effected without unanimous consent. A breach of the
      fundamental principles of the compact by a part of the Society would
      certainly absolve the other part from their obligations to it. If the
      breach of <i>any</i> article by <i>any</i> of the parties, does not set
      the others at liberty, it is because, the contrary is <i>implied</i> in
      the compact itself, and particularly by that law of it, which gives an
      indefinite authority to the majority to bind the whole in all cases. This
      latter circumstance shews that we are not to consider the federal Union as
      analagous to the social compact of individuals: for if it were so, a
      Majority would have a right to bind the rest, and even to form a new
      Constitution for the whole, which the Gentl<sup>n</sup> from N.&nbsp;Jersey
      would be among the last to admit. If we consider the federal Union as
      analagous not to the Social compacts <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page177" id="page177"></a>[pg&nbsp;177]</span> among individual men:
      but to the conventions among individual States, What is the doctrine
      resulting from these conventions? Clearly, according to the Expositors of
      the law of Nations, that a breach of any one article by any one party,
      leaves all the other parties at liberty, to consider the whole convention
      as dissolved, unless they choose rather to compel the delinquent party to
      repair the breach. In some treaties indeed it is expressly stipulated that
      a violation of particular articles shall not have this consequence, and
      even that particular articles shall remain in force during war, which in
      general is understood to dissolve all subsisting Treaties. But are there
      any exceptions of this sort to the Articles of Confederation? So far from
      it that there is not even an express stipulation that force shall be used
      to compell an offending member of the Union to discharge its duty. He
      observed that the violations of the federal articles had been numerous
      &amp; notorious. Among the most notorious was an act of N.&nbsp;Jersey
      herself; by which she <i>expressly refused</i> to comply with a
      Constitutional requisition of Cong<sup>s</sup> and yielded no farther to
      the expostulations of their deputies, than barely to rescind her vote of
      refusal without passing any positive act of compliance. He did not wish to
      draw any rigid inferences from these observations. He thought it proper
      however that the true nature of the existing confederacy should be
      investigated, and he was not anxious to strengthen the foundations on
      which it now stands.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Proceeding to the consideration of M<sup>r</sup> Patterson&#39;s plan, he
      stated the object of a proper plan to be twofold. 1. to preserve the
      Union. 2. to provide a Governm<sup>t</sup> that will remedy the evils felt
      by the States both in their united and individual capacities. Examine M<sup>r</sup>
      P&#39;<sup>s</sup> plan, &amp; say whether it promises satisfaction in
      these respects.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      1. Will it prevent the violations of the law of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page178" id="page178"></a>[pg&nbsp;178]</span> nations &amp; of
      Treaties which if not prevented must involve us in the calamities of
      foreign wars? The tendency of the States to these violations has been
      manifested in sundry instances. The files of Cong<sup>s</sup> contain
      complaints already, from almost every Nation with which treaties have been
      formed. Hitherto indulgence has been shewn to us. This cannot be the
      permanent disposition of foreign nations. A rupture with other powers is
      among the greatest of national calamities. It ought therefore to be
      effectually provided that no part of a nation shall have it in its power
      to bring them on the whole. The existing Confederacy does not sufficiently
      provide against this evil. The proposed amendment to it does not supply
      the omission. It leaves the will of the States as uncontrouled as ever.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      2. Will it prevent encroachments on the federal authority? A tendency to
      such encroachments has been sufficiently exemplified, among ourselves, as
      well as in every other confederated republic antient and modern. By the
      federal articles, transactions with the Indians appertain to Cong<sup>s</sup>.
      Yet in several instances, the States have entered into treaties &amp; wars
      with them. In like manner no two or more States can form among themselves
      any treaties &amp;c. without the consent of Cong<sup>s</sup>. Yet Virg<sup>a</sup>
      &amp; Mary<sup>d</sup> in one instance&mdash;Pen<sup>a</sup> &amp; N.&nbsp;Jersey
      in another, have entered into compacts, without previous application or
      subsequent apology. No State again can of right raise troops in time of
      peace without the like consent. Of all cases of the league, this seems to
      require the most scrupulous observance. Has not Mass<sup>ts</sup>,
      notwithstanding, the most powerful member of the Union, already raised a
      body of troops? Is she not now augmenting them, without having even
      deigned to apprise Cong<sup>s</sup> of Her intention? In fine&mdash;Have
      we not seen the public land dealt out to Con<sup>t</sup> to bribe her
      acquiescence in the decree constitutionally <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page179" id="page179"></a>[pg&nbsp;179]</span> awarded ag<sup>st</sup>
      her claim on the territory of Pen<sup>a</sup>: for no other possible
      motive can account for the policy of Cong<sup>s</sup> in that measure?&mdash;If
      we recur to the examples of other confederacies, we shall find in all of
      them the same tendency of the parts to encroach on the authority of the
      whole. He then reviewed the Amphyctionic &amp; Achæan confederacies among
      the antients, and the Helvetic, Germanic &amp; Belgic among the moderns,
      tracing their analogy to the U. States in the constitution and extent of
      their federal authorities&mdash;in the tendency of the particular members
      to usurp on these authorities, and to bring confusion &amp; ruin on the
      whole.&mdash;He observed that the plan of Mr. Pat[er]son, besides omitting
      a controul over the States as a general defence of the federal
      prerogatives was particularly defective in two of its provisions. 1. Its
      ratification was not to be by the people at large, but by the <i>legislatures</i>.
      It could not therefore render the acts of Cong<sup>s</sup> in pursuance of
      their powers, even legally <i>paramount</i> to the acts of the States. 2.
      It gave to the federal Tribunal an appellate jurisdiction only&mdash;even
      in the criminal cases enumerated. The necessity of any such provision
      supposed a danger of undue acquittals in the State tribunals, of what
      avail c<sup>d</sup> an appellate tribunal be, after an acquittal? Besides
      in most if not all of the States, the Executives have by their respective
      <i>Constitutions</i>, the right of pard<sup>g</sup>. How could this be
      taken from them by a <i>legislative</i> ratification only?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      3. Will it prevent trespasses of the States on each other? Of these enough
      has been already seen. He instanced Acts of Virg<sup>a</sup> &amp;
      Maryland which gave a preference to their own Citizens in cases where the
      Citizens of other States are entitled to equality of privileges by the
      Articles of Confederation. He considered the emissions of paper money
      &amp; other kindred measures as also aggressions. The States <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page180" id="page180"></a>[pg&nbsp;180]</span>
      relatively to one another being each of them either Debtor or Creditor;
      The creditor States must suffer unjustly from every emission by the debtor
      States. We have seen retaliating Acts on the subject which threatened
      danger not to the harmony only, but the tranquillity of the Union. The
      plan of M<sup>r</sup> Paterson, not giving even a negative on the Acts of
      the States, left them as much at liberty as ever to execute their
      unrighteous projects ag<sup>st</sup> each other.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      4. Will it secure the internal tranquillity of the States themselves? The
      insurrections in Mass<sup>ts</sup> admonished all the States of the danger
      to which they were exposed. Yet the plan of M<sup>r</sup> P. contained no
      provisions for supplying the defect of the Confederation on this point.
      According to the Republican theory indeed, Right &amp; power being both
      vested in the majority, are held to be synonymous. According to fact &amp;
      experience, a minority may in an appeal to force be an overmatch for the
      majority. 1. If the minority happen to include all such as possess the
      skill &amp; habits of military life, with such as possess the great
      pecuniary resources, one third may conquer the remaining two thirds. 2.
      one third of those who participate in the choice of rulers may be rendered
      a majority by the accession of those whose poverty disqualifies them from
      a suffrage, &amp; who for obvious reasons may be more ready to join the
      standard of sedition than that of established Government. 3. where slavery
      exists, the Republican Theory becomes still more fallacious.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      5. Will it secure a good internal legislation &amp; administration to the
      particular States? In developing the evils which vitiate the political
      system of the U. S.&nbsp;it is proper to take into view those which
      prevail within the States individually as well as those which affect them
      collectively: Since the former indirectly affect the whole; and there is
      great reason to believe that the pressure of them had a full <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page181" id="page181"></a>[pg&nbsp;181]</span>
      share in the motives which produced the present Convention. Under this
      head he enumerated and animadverted on 1. the multiplicity of the laws
      passed by the several States. 2. the mutability of their laws. 3. the
      injustice of them. 4. the impotence of them: observing that M<sup>r</sup>
      Patterson&#39;s plan contained no remedy for this dreadful class of evils,
      and could not therefore be received as an adequate provision for the
      exigencies of the Community.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      6. Will it secure the Union ag<sup>st</sup> the influence of foreign
      powers over its members. He pretended not to say that any such influence
      had yet been tried: but it was naturally to be expected that occasions
      would produce it. As lessons which claimed particular attention, he cited
      the intrigues practised among the Amphyctionic Confederates first by the
      Kings of Persia, and afterwards fatally by Philip of Macedon: Among the
      Achæans, first by Macedon &amp; afterwards no less fatally by Rome: among
      the Swiss by Austria, France &amp; the lesser neighbouring powers: among
      the members of the Germanic Body by France, England, Spain &amp; Russia&mdash;And
      in the Belgic Republic, by all the great neighbouring powers. The plan of
      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson, not giving to the general Councils any negative
      on the will of the particular States, left the door open for the like
      pernicious Machinations among ourselves.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      7. He begged the smaller States which were most attached to M<sup>r</sup>
      Patterson&#39;s plan to consider the situation in which it would leave
      them. In the first place they would continue to bear the whole expence of
      maintaining their Delegates in Congress. It ought not to be said that if
      they were willing to bear this burthen, no others had a right to complain.
      As far as it led the small States to forbear keeping up a representation,
      by which the public business was delayed, it was evidently a matter of
      common concern. An examination of the minutes of Congress <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page182" id="page182"></a>[pg&nbsp;182]</span>
      would satisfy every one that the public business had been frequently
      delayed by this cause; and that the States most frequently unrepresented
      in Cong<sup>s</sup> were not the larger States. He reminded the Convention
      of another consequence of leaving on a small State the burden of
      maintaining a Representation in Cong<sup>s</sup>. During a considerable
      period of the War, one of the Representatives of Delaware, in whom alone
      before the signing of the Confederation the entire vote of that State and
      after that event one half of its vote, frequently resided, was a Citizen
      &amp; Resident of Pen<sup>a</sup> and held an office in his own State
      incompatible with an appointment from it to Cong<sup>s</sup>. During
      another period, the same State was represented by three delegates two of
      whom were citizens of Penn<sup>a</sup> and the third a Citizen of New
      Jersey. These expedients must have been intended to avoid the burden of
      supporting Delegates from their own State. But whatever might have been y<sup>e</sup>
      cause, was not in effect the vote of one State doubled, and the influence
      of another increased by it? In the 2<sup>d</sup> place the coercion, on
      which the efficacy of the plan depends, can never be exerted but on
      themselves. The larger States will be impregnable, the smaller only can
      feel the vengeance of it. He illustrated the position by the history of
      the Amphyctionic confederates: and the ban of the German Empire. It was
      the cobweb w<sup>ch</sup> could entangle the weak, but would be the sport
      of the strong.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      8. He begged them to consider the situation in which they would remain in
      case their pertinacious adherence to an inadmissible plan, should prevent
      the adoption of any plan. The contemplation of such an event was painful;
      but it would be prudent to submit to the task of examining it at a
      distance, that the means of escaping it might be the more readily
      embraced. Let the Union of the States be dissolved, and one of two
      consequences must happen. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page183"
      id="page183"></a>[pg&nbsp;183]</span> Either the States must remain
      individually independent &amp; sovereign; or two or more Confederacies
      must be formed among them. In the first event would the small States be
      more secure ag<sup>st</sup> the ambition &amp; power of their larger
      neighbours, than they would be under a General Government pervading with
      equal energy every part of the Empire, and having an equal interest in
      protecting every part ag<sup>st</sup> every other part? In the second, can
      the smaller expect that their larger neighbours would confederate with
      them on the principle of the present Confederacy, which gives to each
      member, an equal suffrage; or that they would exact less severe
      concessions from the smaller States, than are proposed in the scheme of M<sup>r</sup>
      Randolph?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The great difficulty lies in the affair of Representation; and if this
      could be adjusted, all others would be surmountable. It was admitted by
      both the gentlemen from N.&nbsp;Jersey, (M<sup>r</sup> Brearly and M<sup>r</sup>
      Patterson) that it would not be <i>just to allow Virg<sup>a</sup></i>
      which was 16 times as large as Delaware an equal vote only. Their language
      was that it would not be <i>safe for Delaware</i> to allow Virg<sup>a</sup>
      16 times as many votes. The expedient proposed by them was that all the
      States should be thrown into one mass and a new partition be made into 13
      equal parts. Would such a scheme be practicable? The dissimilarities
      existing in the rules of property, as well as in the manners, habits and
      prejudices of the different States, amounted to a prohibition of the
      attempt. It had been found impossible for the power of one of the most
      absolute princes in Europe (K. of France) directed by the wisdom of one of
      the most enlightened and patriotic Ministers (M<sup>r</sup> Neckar) that
      any age has produced, to equalize in some points only the different usages
      &amp; regulations of the different provinces. But admitting a general
      amalgamation and repartition of the States to be practicable, and <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page184" id="page184"></a>[pg&nbsp;184]</span>
      the danger apprehended by the smaller States from a proportional
      representation to be real; would not a particular and voluntary coalition
      of these with their neighbours, be less inconvenient to the whole
      community, and equally effectual for their own safety. If N.&nbsp;Jersey
      or Delaware conceived that an advantage would accrue to them from an
      equalization of the States, in which case they would necessarily form a
      junction with their neighbours, why might not this end be attained by
      leaving them at liberty by the Constitution to form such a junction
      whenever they pleased? And why should they wish to obtrude a like
      arrangement on all the States, when it was, to say the least, extremely
      difficult, would be obnoxious to many of the States, and when neither the
      inconveniency, nor the benefit of the expedient to themselves, would be
      lessened by confining it to themselves.&mdash;The prospect of many new
      States to the Westward was another consideration of importance. If they
      should come into the Union at all, they would come when they contained but
      few inhabitants. If they sh<sup>d</sup> be entitled to vote according to
      their proportions of inhabitants, all would be right &amp; safe. Let them
      have an equal vote, and a more objectionable minority than ever might give
      law to the whole.<a name="FNanchor_91_91" id="FNanchor_91_91"></a><a

      (Of M<sup>r</sup> Randolph&#39;s plan as reported from the Com&#771;ittee)&mdash;the

      consisting &amp;c." being taken up in the House.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson observed that by a Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> he
      did not mean one that would swallow up the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> as
      seemed to be wished by some gentlemen. He was tenacious of the idea of
      preserving the latter. He thought, contrary to the opinion of (Col.
      Hamilton) that they might not only subsist but subsist on friendly terms
      with the former. They were absolutely necessary for certain purposes which
      the former could not reach. All large Governments must be subdivided into
      lesser jurisdictions. As Examples he mentioned Persia, Rome, and
      particularly the divisions &amp; subdivisions of England by Alfred.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Hamilton coincided with the proposition as it stood in the Report. He
      had not been understood yesterday. By an abolition of the States, he meant
      that no boundary could be drawn between the National &amp; State
      Legislatures; that the former must therefore have indefinite authority. If
      it were limited at all, the rivalship of the States would gradually
      subvert it. Even as Corporations the extent of some of them as V<sup>a</sup>
      Mass<sup>ts</sup> &amp;c would be formidable. <i>As States</i>, he thought
      they ought to be abolished. But he admitted the necessity of leaving in
      them, subordinate jurisdictions. The examples of Persia &amp; the Roman
      Empire, cited by (M<sup>r</sup> Wilson) were he thought in favor of his
      doctrine: the great powers delegated to the Satraps &amp; proconsuls
      having frequently produced revolts, and schemes of independence.

      M<sup>r</sup> King wished as every thing depended on this proposition,
      that no objections might be improperly indulged ag<sup>st</sup> the
      phraseology of it. He conceived that the import of the term "States"
      "Sovereignty" "<i>national</i>" "federal," had been often used &amp;
      applied in the discussions inaccurately &amp; delusively. The States were
      not "Sovereigns" in the sense contended for by some. They did not possess
      the peculiar features of sovereignty, they could not make war, nor peace,
      nor alliances nor treaties. Considering them as political Beings, they
      were dumb, for they could not speak to any for[~e]gn Sovereign whatever.
      They were deaf, for they could not hear any propositions from such
      Sovereign. They had not even the organs or faculties of defence or
      offence, for they could not of themselves raise troops, or equip vessels,
      for war. On the other side, if the Union of the States comprises the idea
      of a confederation, it comprises that also of consolidation. A Union of
      the States is a Union of the men composing them, from whence a <i>national</i>
      character results to the whole. Cong<sup>s</sup> can act alone without the
      States&mdash;they can act &amp; their acts will be binding ag<sup>st</sup>
      the Instructions of the States. If they declare war: war is de jure
      declared&mdash;captures made in pursuance of it are lawful&mdash;no Acts
      of the States can vary the situation, or prevent the judicial
      consequences. If the States therefore retained some portion of their
      sovereignty, they had certainly divested themselves of essential portions
      of it. If they formed a confederacy in some respects&mdash;they formed a
      Nation in others. The Convention could clearly deliberate on &amp; propose
      any alterations that Cong<sup>s</sup> could have done under y<sup>e</sup>
      federal articles, and Could not Cong<sup>s</sup> propose by virtue of the
      last article, a change in any article whatever; and as well that relating
      to the equality of suffrage, as any other. He made these remarks to
      obviate some scruples which had been expressed. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page187" id="page187"></a>[pg&nbsp;187]</span> He doubted much the
      practicability of annihilating the States; but thought that much of their
      power ought to be taken from them.<a name="FNanchor_92_92"

        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent">
            "Answer (R. King) The States under the confed. are not sovereign
            States they can do no act but such as are of a subordinate nature or
            such as terminate in themselves&mdash;and even these are restrained&mdash;coinage,
            P. office &amp;c they are wholly incompetent to the exercise of any
            of the gt. &amp; distinguishing acts of sovereignty&mdash;They can
            neither make nor receive (embassies) to or from any other sovereign&mdash;they
            have not the powers of injuring another or of defending themselves
            from an Injury offered from one another&mdash;they are deaf, dumb
            and impotent&mdash;these Faculties are yielded up and the U. S.&nbsp;in
            C. Assd. hold and possess them, and they alone can exercise them&mdash;they
            are so far out of the controul of the separate States yt. if every
            State in the Union was to instruct yr. Deleg., and those Delegates
            within ye powers of the Arts. of Union shd. do an act in violation
            of their Instructions it wd. nevertheless be valid. If they declared
            a war, any giving aid or comfort to the enemy wd. be Treason; if
            peace, any capture on the high seas wd. be piracy. This remark
            proves yt. the States are now subordinate corporations or societies
            and not sovereigns&mdash;these imperfect States are the confederates
            and they are the electors of the magistrates who exercise the
            national sovereignty. The Articles of Confedr. and perpetual Union,
            are partly federal &amp; partly of the nature of a constitution or
            form of Govt. arising from and applying to the Citizens of the U. S.&nbsp;&amp;
            not from the individual States.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "The only criterion of determining what is federal &amp; what is
            national is this, those acts which are for the government of the
            States only are purely federal, those which are for the government
            of the Citizens of the individual States are national and not
            federal.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "If then the articles of Confedr. &amp; perpetual union have this
            twofold capacity, and if they provide for an alteration in a certain
            mode, why may not they be so altered as that the federal article may
            be changed to a national one, and the national to a federal? I see
            no argument that can be objected to the authority. The 5th article
            regulates the influence of the several States and makes them equal&mdash;does
            not the confed. authorize this alteration, that instead of this
            Equality, one state may have double the Influence of another&mdash;I
            conceive it does&mdash;and so of every Article except that wh.
            destroys the Idea of a confedy. I think it may be proved that every
            article may be totally altered provided you have one guarantying to
            each State the right of regulating its private &amp; internal
            affairs in the manner of a subordinate corporation.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "But admitting that the Arts, of Confed. &amp; perpet. Union, or the
            powers of the Legis. did not extend to the proposed Reform; yet the
            public Deputations &amp; the public Danger require it&mdash;the
            system proposed to be adopted is no scheme of a day, calculated to
            postpone the hour of Danger, &amp; thus leave it to fall with double
            ruin on our successors&mdash;It is no crude and undigested plan; the
            child of narrow and unextensive views, brought forward under the
            Auspices of Cowardice &amp; Irresolution&mdash;It is a measure of
            Decision, it is the foundation of Freedom &amp; of national Glory.
            It will draw on itself and be able to support the severest scrutiny
            &amp; Examination. It is no idle experiment, no romantic speculation&mdash;the
            measure forces itself upon wise men, and if they have not firmness
            to look it in the face and protect it&mdash;Farewell to the Freedom
            of our Government&mdash;our military glory will be tarnished and our

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson, could not admit the doctrine that when the Colonies
      became independent of G. Britain, they became independent also of each
      other. He read the declaration of Independence, observing thereon that the
      <i>United Colonies</i> were declared to be free &amp; independent States;
      and inferring that they were independent, not <i>individually</i> but <i>Unitedly</i>
      and that they were confederated as they were independent, States.

      Col. Hamilton assented to the doctrine of M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. He denied
      the doctrine that the States were thrown into a State of Nature. He was
      not yet prepared to admit the doctrine that the Confederacy, could be
      dissolved by partial infractions of it. He admitted that the States met
      now on an equal footing but could see no inference from that against
      concerting a change of the system in this particular. He took this
      occasion of observing for the purpose of appeasing the fears of the small
      States, that two circumstances would render them secure under a National
      Gov<sup>t</sup> in which they might lose the equality of rank they now
      held: one was the local situation of the 3 largest States Virg<sup>a</sup>
      Mass<sup>ts</sup> &amp; P<sup>a</sup>. They were separated from each other
      by distance of place, and equally so, by all the peculiarities which
      distinguish the interests of one State from those of another. No
      combination therefore could be dreaded. In the second place, as there was
      a gradation in the States from V<sup>a</sup> the largest down to Delaware
      the smallest, it would always happen that ambitious combinations among a
      few States might &amp; w<sup>d</sup> be counteracted by defensive
      combinations of greater extent among the rest. No combination has been
      seen among the large Counties merely as such, ag<sup>st</sup> lesser
      Counties. The more close the Union of the States, and the more compleat
      the authority of the whole: the less opportunity will be allowed to the
      stronger States to injure the weaker.

      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth 2<sup>ded</sup> by M<sup>r</sup> Gorham, moves to
      alter it so as to run "that the Government of the United <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page190" id="page190"></a>[pg&nbsp;190]</span>
      States ought to consist of a supreme legislative, Executive and
      Judiciary." This alteration he said would drop the word <i>national</i>,
      and retain the proper title "the United States." He could not admit the
      doctrine that a breach of any of the federal articles could dissolve the
      whole. It would be highly dangerous not to consider the Confederation as
      still subsisting. He wished also the plan of the Convention to go forth as
      an amendment of the articles of the Confederation, since under this idea
      the authority of the Legislatures could ratify it. If they are unwilling,
      the people will be so too. If the plan goes forth to the people for
      ratification several succeeding Conventions within the States would be
      unavoidable. He did not like these conventions. They were better fitted to
      pull down than to build up Constitutions.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph. did not object to the change of expression, but
      apprised the gentleman who wished for it that he did not admit it for the
      reasons assigned; particularly that of getting rid of a reference to the
      people for ratification. The motion of M<sup>r</sup> Elsew<sup>th</sup>
      was acquiesced in nem: con:

    <p class="indent">
      The 2<sup>d</sup> Resol: "that the National Legislature ought to consist
      of two branches" taken up, the word "national" struck out as of course.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <i>M<sup>r</sup> Lansing.</i> observed that the true question here was,
      whether the Convention would adhere to or depart from the foundation of
      the present Confederacy; and moved instead of the 2<sup>d</sup>
      Resolution, "that the powers of Legislation be vested in the U. States in
      Congress." He had already assigned two reasons ag<sup>st</sup> such an
      innovation as was proposed: 1. the want of competent powers in the
      Convention.&mdash;2. the state of the public mind. It had been observed by
      (M<sup>r</sup> Madison) in discussing the first point, that in two States
      the Delegates to Cong<sup>s</sup> were chosen by the people.
      Notwithstanding the first appearance <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page191" id="page191"></a>[pg&nbsp;191]</span> of this remark, it
      had in fact no weight, as the Delegates however chosen, did not represent
      the people merely as so many individuals; but as forming a Sovereign
      State. (Mr. Randolph) put it, he said, on its true footing namely that the
      public safety superseded the scruple arising from the review of our
      powers. But in order to feel the force of this consideration, the same
      impression must be had of the public danger. He had not himself the same
      impression, and could not therefore dismiss his scruple. (M<sup>r</sup>
      Wilson) contended that as the Convention were only to recommend, they
      might recommend what they pleased. He differed much from him. Any act
      whatever of so respectable a body must have a great effect, and if it does
      not succeed, will be a source of great dissentions. He admitted that there
      was no certain criterion of the Public mind on the subject. He therefore
      recurred to the evidence of it given by the opposition in the States to
      the scheme of an Impost. It could not be expected that those possessing
      Sovereignty could ever voluntarily part with it. It was not to be expected
      from any one State, much less from thirteen. He proceeded to make some
      observations on the plan itself and the argum<sup>ts</sup> urged in
      support of it. The point of Representation could receive no elucidation
      from the case of England. The corruption of the boroughs did not proceed
      from their comparative smallness; but from the actual fewness of the
      inhabitants, some of them not having more than one or two. A great
      inequality existed in the Counties of England. Yet the like complaint of
      peculiar corruption in the small ones had not been made. It had been said
      that Congress represent the State Prejudices: will not any other body
      whether chosen by the Legislatures or people of the States, also represent
      their prejudices? It had been asserted by his colleague (Col. Hamilton)
      that there was no <span class="pagenum"><a name="page192" id="page192"></a>[pg&nbsp;192]</span>
      coincidence of interests among the large States that ought to excite fears
      of oppression in the smaller. If it were true that such a uniformity of
      interests existed among the States, there was equal safety for all of
      them, whether the representation remained as heretofore, or were
      proportioned as now proposed. It is proposed that the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Legislature shall have a negative on the laws of the States. Is it
      conceivable that there will be leisure for such a task? There will on the
      most moderate calculation, be as many Acts sent up from the States as
      there are days in the year. Will the members of the General Legislature be
      competent Judges? Will a gentleman from Georgia be a judge of the
      expediency of a law which is to operate in N.&nbsp;Hampshire. Such a
      Negative would be more injurious than that of Great Britain heretofore
      was. It is said that the National Gov<sup>t</sup> must have the influence
      arising from the grant of offices and honors. In order to render such a
      Government effectual he believed such an influence to be necessary. But if
      the States will not agree to it, it is in vain, worse than in vain to make
      the proposition. If this influence is to be attained, the States must be
      entirely abolished. Will any one say this would ever be agreed to? He
      doubted whether any Gen<sup>l</sup> Government equally beneficial to all
      can be attained. That now under consideration he is sure, must be utterly
      unattainable. He had another objection. The system was too novel &amp;
      complex. No man could foresee what its operation will be either with
      respect to the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> or the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>.
      One or other it has been surmised must absorb the whole.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason. did not expect this point would have been reagitated. The
      essential differences between the two plans, had been clearly stated. The
      principal objections ag<sup>st</sup> that of M<sup>r</sup> R. were the <i>want
      of power</i> &amp; the <i>want of practicability</i>. There can be no
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page193" id="page193"></a>[pg&nbsp;193]</span>
      weight in the first as the fiat is not to be <i>here</i>, but in the
      people. He thought with his colleague M<sup>r</sup> R. that there were
      besides certain crisises, in which all the ordinary cautions yielded to
      public necessity. He gave as an example, the eventual Treaty with G. B. in
      forming which the Com&#771;<sup>srs</sup> of the U. S. had boldly
      disregarded the improvident shackles of Cong<sup>s</sup> had given to
      their Country an honorable &amp; happy peace, and instead of being
      censured for the transgression of their powers, had raised to themselves a
      monument more durable than brass. The <i>impracticability</i> of gaining
      the public concurrence he thought was still more groundless. (M<sup>r</sup>
      Lansing) had cited the attempts of Congress to gain an enlargement of
      their powers, and had inferred from the miscarriage of these attempts, the
      hopelessness of the plan which he (M<sup>r</sup> L) opposed. He thought a
      very different inference ought to have been drawn; viz that the plan which
      (M<sup>r</sup> L) espoused, and which proposed to augment the powers of
      Congress, never could be expected to succeed. He meant not to throw any
      reflections on Cong<sup>s</sup> as a body, much less on any particular
      members of it. He meant however to speak his sentiments without reserve on
      this subject; it was a privilege of age, and perhaps the only compensation
      which nature had given for, the privation of so many other enjoyments: and
      he should not scruple to exercise it freely. Is it to be thought that the
      people of America, so watchful over their interests; so jealous of their
      liberties, will give up their all, will surrender both the sword and the
      purse, to the same body, and that too not chosen immediately by
      themselves? They never will. They never ought. Will they trust such a
      body, with the regulation of their trade, with the regulation of their
      taxes; with all the other great powers, which are in contemplation? Will
      they give unbounded confidence to a secret Journal&mdash;to the intrigues&mdash;to
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page194" id="page194"></a>[pg&nbsp;194]</span>
      factions which in the nature of things appertain to such an Assembly? If
      any man doubts the existence of these characters of Congress, let him
      consult their Journals for the years 78, 79, &amp; 80.&mdash;It will be
      said, that if the people are averse to parting with power, why is it hoped
      that they will part with it to a National Legislature. The proper answer
      is that in this case they do not part with power: they only transfer it
      from one sett of immediate Representatives to another sett.&mdash;Much has
      been said of the unsettled state of the mind of the people, he believed
      the mind of the people of America, as elsewhere, was unsettled as to some
      points; but settled as to others. In two points he was sure it was well
      settled. 1. in an attachment to Republican Government. 2. in an attachment
      to more than one branch in the Legislature. Their constitutions accord so
      generally in both these circumstances, that they seem almost to have been
      preconcerted. This must either have been a miracle, or have resulted from
      the genius of the people. The only exceptions to the establishm<sup>t</sup>
      of two branches in the Legislatures are the State of P<sup>a</sup> &amp;
      Cong<sup>s</sup> and the latter the only single one not chosen by the
      people themselves. What has been the consequence? The people have been
      constantly averse to giving that Body further powers&mdash;It was
      acknowledged by (M<sup>r</sup> Patterson) that his plan could not be
      enforced without military coercion. Does he consider the force of this
      concession. The most jarring elements of Nature; fire &amp; water
      themselves are not more incompatible that[n] such a mixture of civil
      liberty and military execution. Will the militia march from one State to
      another, in order to collect the arrears of taxes from the delinquent
      members of the Republic? Will they maintain an army for this purpose? Will
      not the Citizens of the invaded State assist one another till they rise as
      one Man, and shake off the Union altogether. <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page195" id="page195"></a>[pg&nbsp;195]</span> Rebellion is the only
      case, in which the military force of the State can be properly exerted ag<sup>st</sup>
      its Citizens. In one point of view he was struck with horror at the
      prospect of recurring to this expedient. To punish the non-payment of
      taxes with death, was a severity not yet adopted by despotism itself: yet
      this unexampled cruelty would be mercy compared to a military collection
      of revenue, in which the bayonet could make no discrimination between the
      innocent and the guilty. He took this occasion to repeat, that
      notwithstanding his solicitude to establish a national Government, he
      never would agree to abolish the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> or render them
      absolutely insignificant. They were as necessary as the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> and he would be equally careful to preserve them. He was
      aware of the difficulty of drawing the line between them, but hoped it was
      not insurmountable. The Convention, tho&#39; comprising so many

      M<sup>r</sup> Luther Martin agreed with (Col Mason) as to the importance
      of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> he would support them at the expence of the
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> which was instituted for the purpose of
      that support. He saw no necessity for two branches, and if it existed
      Congress might be organized into two. He considered Cong<sup>s</sup> as
      representing the people, being chosen by the Legislatures who were chosen
      by the people. At any rate, Congress represented the Legislatures; and it
      was the Legislatures not the people who refused to enlarge their powers.
      Nor could the rule of voting have been the ground of objection, otherwise
      ten of the States must always have been ready, to place further confidence
      in Cong<sup>s</sup>. The causes of repugnance must therefore be looked for
      elsewhere.&mdash;At <span class="pagenum"><a name="page196" id="page196"></a>[pg&nbsp;196]</span>
      the separation from the British Empire, the people of America preferred
      the establishment of themselves into thirteen separate sovereignties
      instead of incorporating themselves into one: to these they look up for
      the security of their lives, liberties &amp; properties: to these they
      must look up. The federal Gov<sup>t</sup> they formed, to defend the whole
      ag<sup>st</sup> foreign nations, in case of war, and to defend the lesser
      States ag<sup>st</sup> the ambition of the larger: they are afraid of
      granting power unnecessarily, lest they should defeat the original end of
      the Union; lest the powers should prove dangerous to the sovereignties of
      the particular States which the Union was meant to support; and expose the
      lesser to being swallowed up by the larger. He conceived also that the
      people of the States having already vested their powers in their
      respective Legislatures, could not resume them without a dissolution of
      their Governments. He was ag<sup>st</sup> Conventions in the States: was
      not ag<sup>st</sup> assisting States ag<sup>st</sup> rebellious subjects;
      thought the <i>federal</i> plan of M<sup>r</sup> Patterson did not require
      coercion more than the <i>National one</i>, as the latter must depend for
      the deficiency of its revenues on requisitions &amp; quotas, and that a
      national Judiciary extended into the States would be ineffectual, and
      would be viewed with a jealousy inconsistent with its usefulness.

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman 2<sup>ded</sup> &amp; supported M<sup>r</sup>
      Lansings motion. He admitted two branches to be necessary in the State
      Legislatures, but saw no necessity for them in a Confederacy of States.
      The examples were all, of a single Council. Cong<sup>s</sup> carried us
      thro&#39; the war, and perhaps as well as any Gov<sup>t</sup> could have
      done. The complaints at present are not that the views of Cong<sup>s</sup>
      are unwise or unfaithful; but that their powers are insufficient for the
      execution of their views. The national debt &amp; the want of power
      somewhere to draw forth the National resources, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page197" id="page197"></a>[pg&nbsp;197]</span> are the great matters
      that press. All the States were sensible of the defect of power in Cong<sup>s</sup>.
      He thought much might be said in apology for the failure of the State
      Legislatures to comply with the Confederation. They were afraid of leaning
      too hard on the people, by accumulating taxes; no <i>constitutional</i>
      rule had been or could be observed in the quotas&mdash;the Accounts also
      were unsettled &amp; every State supposed itself in advance, rather than
      in arrears. For want of a general system, taxes to a due amount had not
      been drawn from trade which was the most convenient resource. As almost
      all the States had agreed to the recommendation of Cong<sup>s</sup> on the
      subject of an impost, it appeared clearly that they were willing to trust
      Cong<sup>s</sup> with power to draw a revenue from Trade. There is no
      weight therefore in the argument drawn from a distrust of Cong<sup>s</sup>
      for money matters being the most important of all, if the people will
      trust them with power as to them, they will trust them with any other
      necessary powers. Cong<sup>s</sup> indeed by the confederation have in
      fact the right of saying how much the people shall pay, and to what
      purpose it shall be applied: and this right was granted to them in the
      expectation that it would in all cases have its effect. If another branch
      were to be added to Cong<sup>s</sup> to be chosen by the people, it would
      serve to embarrass. The people would not much interest themselves in the
      elections, a few designing men in the large districts would carry their
      points, and the people would have no more confidence in their new
      representatives than in Cong<sup>s</sup>. He saw no reason why the State
      Legislatures should be unfriendly as had been suggested, to Cong<sup>s</sup>.
      If they appoint Cong<sup>s</sup> and approve of their measures, they would
      be rather favourable and partial to them. The disparity of the States in
      point of size he perceived was the main difficulty. But the large States
      had not yet <span class="pagenum"><a name="page198" id="page198"></a>[pg&nbsp;198]</span>
      suffered from the equality of votes enjoyed by the small ones. In all
      great and general points, the interests of all the States were the same.
      The State of Virg<sup>a</sup> notwithstanding the equality of votes,
      ratified the Confederation without, or even proposing, any alteration.
      Mass<sup>ts</sup> also ratified without any material difficulty &amp;c. In
      none of the ratifications is the want of two branches noticed or
      complained of. To consolidate the States as some had proposed would
      dissolve our Treaties with foreign Nations, which had been formed with us,
      as <i>Confederated</i> States. He did not however suppose that the
      creation of two branches in the Legislature would have such an effect. If
      the difficulty on the subject of representation can not be otherwise got
      over, he would agree to have two branches, and a proportional
      representation in one of them, provided each State had an equal voice in
      the other. This was necessary to secure the rights of the lesser States;
      otherwise three or four of the large States would rule the others as they
      please. Each State like each individual had its peculiar habits usages and
      manners, which constituted its happiness. It would not therefore give to
      others a power over this happiness, any more than an individual would do,
      when he could avoid it.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. urged the necessity of two branches; observed that
      if a proper model were not to be found in other Confederacies it was not
      to be wondered at. The number of them was small &amp; the duration of some
      at least short. The Amphyctionic and Achæan were formed in the infancy of
      political Science; and appear by their History &amp; fate, to have
      contained radical defects. The Swiss &amp; Belgic Confederacies were held
      together not by any vital principle of energy but by the incumbent
      pressure of formidable neighbouring nations: The German owed its
      continuance to the influence of the H. of Austria. He <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page199" id="page199"></a>[pg&nbsp;199]</span> appealed to our own
      experience for the defects of our Confederacy. He had been 6 years in the
      12 since the commencement of the Revolution, a member of Congress, and had
      felt all its weaknesses. He appealed to the recollection of others whether
      on many important occasions, the public interest had not been obstructed
      by the small members of the Union. The success of the Revolution was owing
      to other causes, than the Constitution of Congress. In many instances it
      went on even ag<sup>st</sup> the difficulties arising from Cong<sup>s</sup>
      themselves. He admitted that the large States did accede as had been
      stated, to the Confederation in its present form. But it was the effect of
      necessity not of choice. There are other instances of their yielding from
      the same motive to the unreasonable measures of the small States. The
      situation of things is now a little altered. He insisted that a jealousy
      would exist between the State Legislatures &amp; the General Legislature:
      observing that the members of the former would have views &amp; feelings
      very distinct in this respect from their constituents. A private Citizen
      of a State is indifferent whether power be exercised by the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      or State Legislatures, provided it be exercised most for his happiness.
      His representative has an interest in its being exercised by the body to
      which he belongs. He will therefore view the National Legisl: with the eye
      of a jealous rival. He observed that the addresses of Cong<sup>s</sup> to
      the people at large, had always been better received &amp; produced
      greater effect, than those made to the Legislatures.

      two plans which had been proposed from Virginia &amp; N.&nbsp;Jersey, it

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson&#39;s respect for Doc<sup>r</sup> Johnson, added to
      the importance of the subject led him to attempt, unprepared as he was, to
      solve the difficulty which had been started. It was asked how the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> and individuality of the particular States could be
      reconciled to each other; and how the latter could be secured ag<sup>st</sup>
      the former? Might it not, on the other side be asked how the former was to
      be secured ag<sup>st</sup> the latter? It was generally admitted that a
      jealousy &amp; rivalship would be felt between the Gen<sup>l</sup> &amp;
      particular Gov<sup>ts</sup>. As the plan now stood, tho&#39; indeed
      contrary to his opinion, one branch of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      (the Senate or second branch) was to be appointed by the State
      Legislatures. The State Legislatures, therefore, by this participation in
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> would have an opportunity of defending
      their rights. Ought not a reciprocal opportunity to be given to the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> of defending itself by having an appointment of some one
      constituent branch of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>. If a security be
      necessary on one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page202" id="page202"></a>[pg&nbsp;202]</span>
      side, it w<sup>d</sup> seem reasonable to demand it on the other. But
      taking the matter in a more general view, he saw no danger to the States
      from the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>. In case a combination should be
      made by the large ones it w<sup>d</sup> produce a general alarm among the
      rest; and the project w<sup>d</sup> be frustrated. But there was no
      temptation to such a project. The States having in general a similar
      interest, in case of any propositions in the National Legislature to
      encroach on the State Legislatures, he conceived a general alarm w<sup>d</sup>
      take place in the National Legislature itself, that it would communicate
      itself to the State Legislatures, and w<sup>d</sup> finally spread among
      the people at large. The Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> will be as ready
      to preserve the rights of the States as the latter are to preserve the
      rights of individuals; all the members of the former, having a common
      interest, as representatives of all the people of the latter, to leave the
      State Gov<sup>ts</sup> in possession of what the people wish them to
      retain. He could not discover, therefore any danger whatever on the side
      from which it was apprehended. On the contrary, he conceived that in spite
      of every precaution the General Gov<sup>t</sup> would be in perpetual
      danger of encroachments from the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison was of opinion that there was 1. less danger of
      encroachment from the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> than from the State
      Gov<sup>ts</sup> 2. that the mischief from encroachments would be less
      fatal if made by the former, than if made by the latter. 1. All the
      examples of other confederacies prove the greater tendency in such systems
      to anarchy than to tyranny; to a disobedience of the members than
      usurpations of the federal head. Our own experience had fully illustrated
      this tendency.&mdash;But it will be said that the proposed change in the
      principles &amp; form of the Union will vary the tendency; that the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> will have real &amp; greater powers, and will be derived
      in one branch at least from the people, <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page203" id="page203"></a>[pg&nbsp;203]</span> not from the Gov<sup>ts</sup>
      of the States. To give full force to this objection, let it be supposed
      for a moment that indefinite power should be given to the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Legislature, and the States reduced to Corporations dependent on the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Legislature; Why sh<sup>d</sup> it follow that the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      w<sup>d</sup> take from the States any branch of their power as far as its
      operation was beneficial, and its continuance desireable to the people? In
      some of the States, particularly in Connecticut, all the Townships are
      incorporated, and have a certain limited jurisdiction. Have the
      Representatives of the people of the Townships in the Legislature of the
      State ever endeavoured to despoil the Townships of any part of their local
      authority? As far as this local authority is convenient to the people they
      are attached to it; and their representatives chosen by &amp; amenable to
      them, naturally respect their attachment to this, as much as their
      attachment to any other right or interest. The relation of a General Gov<sup>t</sup>
      to State Gov<sup>ts</sup> is parallel. 2. Guards were more necessary ag<sup>st</sup>
      encroachments of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> on the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      than of the latter on the former. The great objection made ag<sup>st</sup>
      an abolition of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> was that the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> could not extend its care to all the minute objects which
      fall under the cognizance of the local jurisdictions. The objection as
      stated lay not ag<sup>st</sup> the probable abuse of the general power,
      but ag<sup>st</sup> the imperfect use that could be made of it throughout
      so great an extent of country, and over so great a variety of objects. As
      far as its operation would be practicable it could not in this view be
      improper; as far as it would be impracticable, the conveniency of the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> itself would concur with that of the people in the
      maintenance of subordinate Governments. Were it practicable for the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> to extend its care to every requisite object without the
      cooperation of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> the people would not <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page204" id="page204"></a>[pg&nbsp;204]</span> be
      less free as members of one great Republic than as members of thirteen
      small ones. A Citizen of Delaware was not more free than a Citizen of
      Virginia: nor would either be more free than a Citizen of America.
      Supposing therefore a tendency in the Gen<sup>l</sup> Government to absorb
      the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> no fatal consequence could result. Taking the
      reverse as the supposition, that a tendency should be left in the State
      Gov<sup>ts</sup> towards an independence on the General Gov<sup>t</sup>
      and the gloomy consequences need not be pointed out. The imagination of
      them, must have suggested to the States the experiment we are now making
      to prevent the calamity, and must have formed the chief motive with those
      present to undertake the arduous task.

      M<sup>r</sup> Mason urged the necessity of retaining the election by the
      people. Whatever inconveniency may attend the democratic principle, it
      must actuate one part of the Gov<sup>t</sup>. It is the only security for
      the rights of the people.

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman, would like an election by the Legislatures best,
      but is content with the plan as it stands.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge could not admit the solidity of the distinction
      between a mediate &amp; immediate election by the people. It was the same
      thing to act by oneself, and to act by another. An election by the
      Legislature would be more refined than an election immediately by the
      people: and would be more likely to correspond with the sense of the whole
      community. If this Convention had been chosen by the people in districts
      it is not to be supposed that such proper characters would have been
      preferred. The Delegates to Cong<sup>s</sup> he thought had also been
      fitter men than would have been appointed by the people at large.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson considered the election of the 1<sup>st</sup> branch
      by the people not only as the Corner Stone, but as the foundation of the
      fabric: and that the difference between a mediate &amp; immediate election
      was immense. The difference was particularly worthy of notice in this
      respect: that the Legislatures are <span class="pagenum"><a name="page206"
      id="page206"></a>[pg&nbsp;206]</span> actuated not merely by the sentiment
      of the people; but have an official sentiment opposed to that of the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> and perhaps to that of the people themselves.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> King enlarged on the same distinction. He supposed the
      Legislatures w<sup>d</sup> constantly choose men subservient to their own
      views as contrasted to the general interest; and that they might even
      devise modes of election that w<sup>d</sup> be subversive of the end in
      view. He remarked several instances in which the views of a State might be
      at variance with those of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>: and
      mentioned particularly a competition between the National &amp; State
      debts, for the most certain &amp; productive funds.

      mischievous. He would have preferred annual to biennial, but for the
      extent of the U. S.&nbsp;and the inconveniency which would result from
      them to the representatives of the extreme parts of the Empire. The people
      were attached to frequency of elections. All the Constitutions of the

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson being for making the 1<sup>st</sup> branch an
      effectual representation of the people at large, preferred an annual
      election of it. This frequency was most familiar &amp; pleasing to the
      people. It would not be more inconvenient to them, than triennial
      elections, as the people in all the States have annual <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page208" id="page208"></a>[pg&nbsp;208]</span>
      meetings with which the election of the National representatives might be
      made to co-incide. He did not conceive that it would be necessary for the
      Nat<sup>l</sup> Leigsl: to sit constantly; perhaps not half&mdash;perhaps
      not one fourth of the year.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison was persuaded that annual elections would be
      extremely inconvenient and apprehensive that biennial would be too much
      so; he did not mean inconvenient to the electors; but to the
      representatives. They would have to travel seven or eight hundred miles
      from the distant parts of the Union; and would probably not be allowed
      even a reimbursement of their expences. Besides, none of those who wished
      to be re-elected would remain at the seat of Governm<sup>t</sup>;
      confiding that their absence would not affect them. The members of Cong<sup>s</sup>
      had done this with few instances of disappointment. But as the choice was
      here to be made by the people themselves who would be much less
      complaisant to individuals, and much more susceptible of impressions from
      the presence of a Rival candidate, it must be supposed that the members
      from the most distant States would travel backwards &amp; forwards at
      least as often as the elections should be repeated. Much was to be said
      also on the time requisite for new Members who would always form a large
      proportion, to acquire that knowledge of the affairs of the States in
      general without which their trust could not be usefully discharged.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman preferred annual elections, but would be content
      with biennial. He thought the Representatives ought to return home and mix
      with the people. By remaining at the seat of Gov<sup>t</sup> they would
      acquire the habits of the place which might differ from those of their
      Constituents.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason observed that the States being differently situated such a rule
      ought to be formed as would put them as nearly as possible on a level. If
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page209" id="page209"></a>[pg&nbsp;209]</span>
      elections were annual the middle States would have a great advantage over
      the extreme ones. He wished them to be biennial; and the rather as in that
      case they would coincide with the periodical elections of S.&nbsp;Carolina
      as well of the other States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Hamilton urged the necessity of 3 years, there ought to be neither
      too much nor too little dependence, on the popular sentiments. The checks
      in the other branches of the Govern<sup>t</sup> would be but feeble, and
      would need every auxiliary principle that could be interwoven. The British
      House of Commons were elected septennially, yet the democratic spirit of y<sup>e</sup>
      Constitution had not ceased. Frequency of elections tended to make the
      people listless to them; and to facilitate the success of little cabals.
      This evil was complained of in all the States. In Virg<sup>a</sup> it had
      been lately found necessary to force the attendance &amp; voting of the
      people by severe regulations.

      people, he thought it neither incumbent on nor honorable for the
      Convention, to sacrifice right &amp; justice to that consideration. If the
      States were to pay the members of the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature, a

      compensation to be allowed. A reserve on that point, or a reference to the
      Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature of the quantum, would excite greater
      opposition than any sum that would be actually necessary or proper.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman contended for referring both the quantum and the

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson was ag<sup>st</sup> <i>fixing</i> the compensation as

      by the Constitution, which might be done by taking a standard which w<sup>d</sup>
      not vary with circumstances. He disliked particularly the policy suggested
      by M<sup>r</sup> Williamson of leaving the members from the poor States
      beyond the Mountains, to the precarious &amp; parsimonious support of
      their constituents. If the Western States hereafter arising should be
      admitted into the Union, they ought to be considered as equals &amp; as
      brethren. If their representatives were to be associated in the Common

      for the members of the 1<sup>st</sup> branch." He thought it absurd that a
      man today should not be permitted by the law to make a bargain for
      himself, and tomorrow should be authorized to manage the affairs of a
      great nation. It was more extraordinary as every man carried with him in
      his own experience a scale for measuring the deficiency of young
      politicians; since he would if interrogated be obliged to declare that his
      political opinions at the age of 21. were too crude &amp; erroneous to
      merit an influence on public measures. It had been said that Cong<sup>s</sup>
      had proved a good school for our young men. It might be so for any thing
      he knew but if it were, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page214"

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson was ag<sup>st</sup> abridging the rights of election
      in any shape. It was the same thing whether this were done by
      disqualifying the objects of choice, or the persons chusing. The motion
      tended to damp the efforts of genius, and of laudable ambition. There was
      no more reason for incapacitating <i>youth</i> than <i>age</i>, where the
      requisite qualifications were found. Many instances might be mentioned of
      signal services rendered in high stations to the public before the age of
      25: The present M<sup>r</sup> Pitt and Lord Bolingbroke were striking
      instances.

        <blockquote>

            "Mr. Madison. Some gentlemen give too much weight and others too
            little to this subject. If you have no exclusive clause, there may
            be danger of creating offices or augmenting the stipends of those
            already created, in order to gratify some members if they were not
            excluded. Such an instance has fallen within my own observation. I
            am therefore of opinion, that no office ought to be open to a
            member, which may be created or augmented while he is in the
            legislature."&mdash;Yates, <i>Secret Proceedings</i>, etc., 155.
            Yates gives the rest of the debate as follows:
          </p>
          <blockquote>
            <p class="indent">
              "Mr. Mason. It seems as if it was taken for granted, that all
              offices will be filled by the executive, while I think many will
              remain in the gift of the legislature. In either case, it is
              necessary to shut the door against corruption. If otherwise, they
              may make or multiply offices, in order to fill them. Are gentlemen
              in earnest when they suppose that this exclusion will prevent the
              first characters from coming forward? Are we not struck at seeing
              the luxury and venality which has already crept in among us? If
              not checked we shall have ambassadors to every petty state in
              Europe&mdash;the little republic of <i>St. Marino</i> not
              excepted. We must in the present system remove the temptation. I
              admire many parts of the British constitution and government, but
              I detest their corruption.&mdash;Why has the power of the crown so
              remarkably increased the last century? A stranger, by reading
              their laws, would suppose it considerably diminished; and yet, by
              the sole power of appointing the increased officers of government,
              corruption pervades every town and village in the kingdom. If such
              a restriction should abridge the right of election, it is still
              necessary, as it will prevent the people from ruining themselves;
              and will not the same causes here produce the same effects? I
              consider this clause as the corner-stone on which our liberties
              depend&mdash;and if we strike it out we are erecting a fabric for
              our destruction.

              "Mr. Gorham. The corruption of the English government cannot be
              applied to America. This evil exists there in the venality of
              their boroughs; but even this corruption has its advantage, as it
              gives stability to their government. We do not know what the
              effect would be if members of parliament were excluded from
              offices. The great bulwark of our liberty is the frequency of
              elections, and the great danger is the septennial parliaments.

              "Mr. Hamilton. In all general questions which become the subjects
              of discussion, there are always some truths mixed with falsehoods.
              I confess there is danger where men are capable of holding two
              offices. Take mankind in general, they are vicious&mdash;their
              passions may be operated upon. We have been taught to reprobate
              the danger of influence in the British government, without duly
              reflecting how far it was necessary to support a good government.
              We have taken up many ideas on trust, and at last, pleased with
              their own opinions, establish them as undoubted truths. Hume&#39;s
              opinion of the British constitution confirms the remark, that
              there is always a body of firm patriots, who often shake a corrupt
              administration. Take mankind as they are, and what are they
              governed by? Their passions. There may be in every government a
              few choice spirits, who may act from more worthy motives. One
              great error is that we suppose mankind more honest than they are.
              Our prevailing passions are ambition and interest; and it will
              ever be the duty of a wise government to avail itself of those
              passions, in order to make them subservient to the public good&mdash;for
              these ever induce us to action. Perhaps a few men in a state, may,
              from patriotic motives, or to display their talents, or to reap
              the advantage of public applause, step forward; but if we adopt
              the clause, we destroy the motive. I am therefore against all
              exclusions and refinements, except only in this case; that when a
              member takes his seat, he should vacate every other office. It is
              difficult to put any exclusive regulation into effect. We must in
              some degree submit to the inconvenience."&mdash;Yates, <i>Secret

            "Mr. Mason. I differ from my colleague in his proposed amendment.
            Let me state the practice in the state where we came from. There,
            all officers are appointed by the legislature. Need I add, that many
            of their appointments are most shameful. Nor will the check proposed
            by this amendment be sufficient. It will soon cease to be any check
            at all. It is asserted that it will be very difficult to find men
            sufficiently qualified as legislators without the inducement of
            emolument. I do believe that men of genius will be deterred unless
            possessed of great virtues. We may well dispense with the first
            characters when destitute of virtue&mdash;I should wish them never
            to come forward&mdash;But if we do not provide against corruption,
            our government will soon be at an end; nor would I wish to put a man
            of virtue in the way of temptation. Evasions and caballing would
            evade the amendment. Nor would the danger be less, if the executive
            has the appointment of officers. The first three or four years we
            might go on well enough; but what would be the case afterwards? I

            from various motives, to support its members; but it is not always
            done from the base motives of venality. Friendship, and a knowledge
            of the abilities of those with whom they associate, may produce it.
            If you bar the door against such attachments, you deprive the
            government of its greatest strength and support. Can you always rely
            on the patriotism of the members? If this be the only inducement,
            you will find a great indifferency in filling your legislative body.
            If we expect to call forth useful characters, we must hold out
            allurements; nor can any great inconveniency arise from such
            inducements. The legislative body must be the road to public honor;

      to offices. One branch of corruption would indeed remain, that of creating
      unnecessary offices, or granting unnecessary salaries, and for that the
      amendment would be a proper remedy. He animadverted on the impropriety of
      stigmatizing with the name of venality the laudable ambition of rising
      into the honorable offices of the Government; an ambition most likely to
      be felt in the early &amp; most incorrupt period of life, &amp; which all
      wise &amp; free Gov<sup>ts</sup> had deemed it sound policy, to cherish,
      not to check. The members of the Legislature have perhaps the hardest
      &amp; least profitable task of any who engage in the service of the state.
      Ought this merit to be made a disqualification?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman observed that the motion did not go far enough. It
      might be evaded by the creation of a new office, the translation to it of
      a person from another office, and the appointment of a member of the
      Legislature to the latter. A new Embassy might be established to a new
      Court, &amp; an ambassador taken from another, in order to <i>create</i> a
      vacancy for a favorite member. He admitted that inconveniences lay on both
      sides. He hoped there w<sup>d</sup> be sufficient inducements to the
      public service without resorting to the prospect of desirable offices, and
      on the whole was rather ag<sup>st</sup> the motion of M<sup>r</sup>
      Madison.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry thought there was great weight in the objection of M<sup>r</sup>
      Sherman. He added as another objection ag<sup>st</sup> admitting the
      eligibility of members in any case that it would produce intrigues of
      ambitious <span class="pagenum"><a name="page221" id="page221"></a>[pg&nbsp;221]</span>

      King he observed that although members, if disqualified themselves might
      still intrigue &amp; cabal for their sons, brothers &amp;c, yet as their
      own interests would be dearer to them, than those of their nearest
      connections, it might be expected they would go greater lengths to promote
      it.

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison had been led to this motion as a middle ground
      between an eligibility in all cases, and an absolute disqualification. He
      admitted the probable abuses of an eligibility of the members, to offices
      particularly within the gift of the Legislature. He had witnessed the
      partiality of such bodies to their own members, as had been remarked of
      the Virginia Assembly by his colleague (Col. Mason). He appealed however
      to him, in turn to vouch another fact not less notorious in Virginia, that
      the backwardness of the best citizens to engage in the Legislative service
      gave but too great success to unfit characters. The question was not to be
      viewed on one side only. The advantages &amp; disadvantages on both ought
      to be fairly compared. The objects to be aimed at were to fill all offices
      with the fittest characters, &amp; to draw the wisest &amp; most worthy
      citizens into the Legislative service. If on one hand, public bodies were
      partial to their own members; on the other they were as apt to be misled
      by taking characters on report, or the authority of patrons and
      dependents.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page222" id="page222"></a>[pg&nbsp;222]</span>
      All who had been concerned in the appointment of strangers on those
      recommendations must be sensible of this truth. Nor w<sup>d</sup> the
      partialities of such Bodies be obviated by disqualifying their own
      members. Candidates for office would hover round the seat of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      or be found among the residents there, and practise all the means of
      counting the favor of the members. A great proportion of the appointments
      made by the States were evidently brought about in this way. In the
      General Gov<sup>t</sup> the evil must be still greater, the characters of
      distant states, being much less known throughout the U. States than those
      of the distant parts of the same State. The elections by Congress had
      generally turned on men living at the seat of the fed<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      or in its neighbourhood.&mdash;As to the next object, the impulse to the
      Legislative service, was evinced by experience to be in general too feeble
      with those best qualified for it. This inconveniency w<sup>d</sup> also be
      more felt in the Nat<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> than in the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>
      as the Sacrifices req<sup>d</sup> from the distant members, w<sup>d</sup>
      be much greater, and the pecuniary provisions, probably, more
      disproportionate. It w<sup>d</sup> therefore be impolitic to add fresh
      objections to the Legislative service by an absolute disqualification of
      its members. The point in question was whether this would be an objection
      with the most capable citizens. Arguing from experience he concluded that
      it would. The Legislature of Virg<sup>a</sup> would probably have been
      without many of its best members, if in that situation, they had been
      ineligible to Cong<sup>s</sup> to the Gov<sup>t</sup> &amp; other
      honorable offices of the State.

      The efficacy of the System will depend on this article. In order to form a
      right judgm<sup>t</sup> in the case, it will be proper to examine the
      situation of this Country more accurately than it has yet been done. The
      people of the U. States are perhaps the most singular of any we are
      acquainted with. Among them there are fewer distinctions of fortune &amp;
      less of rank, than among the inhabitants of any other nation. Every
      freeman has a right to the same protection &amp; security; and a very
      moderate share of property entitles them to the possession of all the
      honors and privileges the Public can bestow: hence arises a greater
      equality, than is to be found among the people of any other Country, and
      an equality which is more likely to continue&mdash;I say this equality is
      likely to continue, because in a new Country, possessing immense tracts of
      uncultivated lands, where every temptation is offered to emigration &amp;
      where industry must be rewarded with competency, there will be few poor,
      and few dependent&mdash;Every member of the Society almost, will enjoy an

      to fill the offices of Government&mdash;the whole community will enjoy in
      the fullest sense that kind of political liberty which consists in the
      power the members of the State reserve to themselves, of arriving at the
      Public offices, or at least, of having votes in the nomination of those

      If this State of things is true &amp; the prospect of its continuing
      probable, it is perhaps not politic to endeavour too close an imitation of
      a Government calculated for a people whose situation is, &amp; whose views
      ought to be extremely different.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Much has been said of the Constitution of G. Britain. I will confess that
      I believe it to be the best Constitution in existence; but at the same
      time I am confident it is one that will not or cannot be introduced into
      this Country, for many centuries.&mdash;If it were proper to go here into
      a historical dissertation on the British Constitution, it might easily be
      shewn that the peculiar excellence, the distinguishing feature of that
      Governm<sup>t</sup> cannot possibly be introduced into our System&mdash;that
      its balance between the Crown &amp; the people cannot be made a part of
      our Constitution,&mdash;that we neither have nor can have the members to
      compose it, nor the rights, privileges &amp; properties of so distinct a
      class of Citizens to guard,&mdash;that the materials for forming this
      balance or check do not exist, nor is there a necessity for having so
      permanent a part of our Legislative, until the Executive power is so
      constituted as to have something fixed &amp; dangerous in its principle&mdash;By
      this I mean a sole, hereditary, though limited Executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      That we cannot have a proper body for forming a Legislative balance
      between the inordinate power of the Executive and the people, is evident
      from a review of the accidents &amp; circumstances which gave rise to the
      peerage of Great Britain&mdash;I believe it is well ascertained that the
      parts which compose the British Constitution arose immediately from the
      forests of Germany; but the antiquity of the establishment of Nobility is
      by no means clearly defined. Some authors are of opinion that the dignity
      denoted by the titles of dux et comes, was derived from the old Roman to
      the German Empire; while others are of the opinion that they existed among
      the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page226" id="page226"></a>[pg&nbsp;226]</span>
      Germans long before the Romans were acquainted with them. The institution
      however of Nobility is immemorial among the Nations who may properly be
      termed the ancestors of Britain.&mdash;At the time they were summoned in
      England to become a part of the National Council, the circumstances which
      contributed to make them a Constituent part of that constitution, must be
      well known to all gentlemen who have had industry &amp; curiosity enough
      to investigate the subject&mdash;The Nobles with their possessions &amp;
      dependents composed a body permanent in their nature and formidable in
      point of power. They had a distinct interest both from the King and the
      people; an interest which could only be represented by themselves, and the
      guardianship could not be safely intrusted to others.&mdash;At the time
      they were originally called to form a part of the National Council,
      necessity perhaps as much as other cause, induced the Monarch to look up
      to them. It was necessary to demand the aid of his subjects in personal
      &amp; pecuniary services. The power and possessions of the Nobility would
      not permit taxation from any Assembly of which they were not a part: &amp;
      the blending the Deputies of the Commons with them, &amp; thus forming
      what they called their parlerment was perhaps as much the effect of chance
      as of any thing else. The Commons were at that time compleatly subordinate
      to the nobles, whose consequence &amp; influence seem to have been the
      only reasons for their superiority; a superiority so degrading to the
      Commons that in the first summons we find the peers are called upon to
      consult the commons to consent. From this time the peers have composed a
      part of the British Legislature, and notwithstanding their power and
      influence have diminished &amp; those of the Commons have increased, yet
      still they have always formed an excellent balance ag<sup>st</sup> either
      the encroachments of the Crown or the people.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page227" id="page227"></a>[pg&nbsp;227]</span>
      I have said that such a body cannot exist in this Country for ages, and
      that untill the situation of our people is exceedingly changed no
      necessity will exist for so permanent a part of the Legislature. To
      illustrate this I have remarked that the people of the United States are
      more equal in their circumstances than the people of any other Country&mdash;that
      they have very few rich men among them,&mdash;by rich men I mean those
      whose riches may have a dangerous influence, or such as are esteemed rich
      in Europe&mdash;perhaps there are not one hundred such on the Continent;
      that it is not probable this number will be greatly increased; that the
      genius of the people their mediocrity of situation &amp; the prospects
      which are afforded their industry in a Country which must be a new one for
      centuries are unfavorable to the rapid distinction of ranks. The
      destruction of the right of primogeniture &amp; the equal division of the
      property of Intestates will also have an effect to preserve this
      mediocrity; for laws invariably affect the manners of a people. On the
      other hand that vast extent of unpeopled territory which opens to the
      frugal &amp; industrious a sure road to competency &amp; independence will
      effectually prevent for a considerable time the increase of the poor or
      discontented, and be the means of preserving that equality of condition
      which so eminently distinguishes us.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      If equality is as I contend the leading feature of the U. States, where
      then are the riches &amp; wealth whose representation &amp; protection is
      the peculiar province of this Permanent body. Are they in the hands of the
      few who may be called rich; in the possession of less than a hundred
      citizens? Certainly not. They are in the great body of the people, among
      whom there are no men of wealth, and very few of real poverty.&mdash;Is it
      probable that a change will be created, and that a new order of men will
      arise? If under the British Government, for a <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page228" id="page228"></a>[pg&nbsp;228]</span> century no such
      change was probable, I think it may be fairly concluded it will not take
      place while even the semblance of Republicanism remains.&mdash;How is this
      change to be effected? Where are the sources from whence it is to flow?
      From the landed interest? No. That is too unproductive &amp; too much
      divided in most of the States. From the Monied interest? If such exists at
      present, little is to be apprehended from that source. Is it to spring
      from commerce? I believe it would be the first instance in which a
      nobility sprang from merchants. Besides, Sir, I apprehend that on this
      point the policy of the U. States has been much mistaken. We have unwisely
      considered ourselves as the inhabitants of an old instead of a new
      country. We have adopted the maxims of a State full of people &amp;
      manufactures &amp; established in credit. We have deserted our true
      interest, and instead of applying closely to those improvements in
      domestic policy which would have ensured the future importance of our
      commerce, we have rashly &amp; prematurely engaged in schemes as extensive
      as they are imprudent. This however is an error which daily corrects
      itself &amp; I have no doubt that a few more severe trials will convince
      us, that very different commercial principles ought to govern the conduct
      of these States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The people of this Country are not only very different from the
      inhabitants of any State we are acquainted with in the modern world; but I
      assert that their situation is distinct from either the people of Greece
      or Rome, or of any State we are acquainted with among the antients.&mdash;Can
      the orders introduced by the institution of Solon, can they be found in
      the United States? Can the military habits &amp; manners of Sparta be
      resembled to our habits &amp; manners? Are the distinction of Patrician
      &amp; Plebeian known among us? Can the Helvetic or Belgic confederacies,
      or can the unwieldy, unmeaning body called <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page229" id="page229"></a>[pg&nbsp;229]</span> the Germanic Empire,
      can they be said to possess either the same or a situation like ours? I
      apprehend not.&mdash;They are perfectly different, in their distinctions
      of rank, their Constitutions, their manners &amp; their policy.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Our true situation appears to me to be this,&mdash;a new extensive Country
      containing within itself the materials for forming a Government capable of
      extending to its Citizens all the blessings of Civil &amp; religious
      liberty&mdash;capable of making them happy at home. This is the great end
      of Republican Establishments. We mistake the object of our Government, if
      we hope or wish that it is to make us respectable abroad. Conquest or
      superiority among other powers is not or ought not ever to be the object
      of republican Systems. If they are sufficiently active &amp; energetic to
      rescue us from contempt &amp; preserve our domestic happiness &amp;
      security, it is all we can expect from them,&mdash;it is more than almost
      any other Government ensures to its citizens.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      I believe this observation will be found generally true:&mdash;that no two
      people are so exactly alike in their situation or circumstances as to
      admit the exercise of the same Government with equal benefit; that a
      system must be suited to the habits &amp; genius of the People it is to
      govern, and must grow out of them.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The people of the U. S.&nbsp;may be divided into three classes&mdash;<i>Professional
      men</i> who must from their particular pursuits always have a considerable
      weight in the Government while it remains popular&mdash;<i>Commercial men</i>,
      who may or may not have weight as a wise or injudicious commercial policy
      is pursued.&mdash;If that commercial policy is pursued which I conceive to
      be the true one, the merchants of this Country will not or ought not for a
      considerable time to have much weight in the political scale.&mdash;The
      third is the <i>landed interest</i>, the owners and <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page230" id="page230"></a>[pg&nbsp;230]</span> cultivators of the
      soil, who are and ought ever to be the governing spring in the system.&mdash;These
      three classes, however distinct in their pursuits are individually equal
      in the political scale, and may be easily proved to have but one interest.
      The dependence of each on the other is mutual. The merchant depends on the
      planter. Both must in private as well as public affairs be connected with
      the professional men; who in their turn must in some measure depend on
      them. Hence it is clear from this manifest connection, &amp; the equality
      which I before stated exists, &amp; must for the reasons then assign,
      continue, that after all there is one, but one great &amp; equal body of
      Citizens composing the inhabitants of this Country among whom there are no
      distinctions of rank, and very few or none of fortune.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      For a people thus circumstanced are we then to form a Government &amp; the
      question is what sort of Government is best suited to them.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Will it be the British Gov<sup>t</sup>? No. Why? Because G. Britain
      contains three orders of people distinct in their situation, their
      possessions &amp; their principles.&mdash;These orders combined form the
      great body of the Nation. And as in national expences the wealth of the
      whole community must contribute, so ought each component part to be
      properly &amp; duly represented.&mdash;No other combination of power could
      form this due representation, but the one that exists.&mdash;Neither the
      peers or the people could represent the royalty, nor could the Royalty
      &amp; the people form a proper representation for the Peers.&mdash;Each
      therefore must of necessity be represented by itself, or the sign of
      itself; and this accidental mixture has certainly formed a Government
      admirably well balanced.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      But the U. States contain but one order that can be assimilated to the
      British Nation,&mdash;this is the order of Commons. They will not surely
      then attempt to form a Government consisting of three <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page231" id="page231"></a>[pg&nbsp;231]</span> branches, two of
      which shall have nothing to represent. They will not have an Executive
      &amp; Senate (hereditary) because the King &amp; Lords of England are so.
      The same reasons do not exist and therefore the same provisions are not
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      We must as has been observed suit our Governm<sup>t</sup> to the people it
      is to direct. These are I believe as active, intelligent &amp; susceptible
      of good Governm<sup>t</sup> as any people in the world. The Confusion
      which has produced the present relaxed State is not owing to them. It is
      owing to the weakness &amp; (defects) of a Gov<sup>t</sup> incapable of
      combining the various interests it is intended to unite, and destitute of
      energy.&mdash;All that we have to do then is to distribute the powers of
      Gov<sup>t</sup> in such a manner, and for such limited periods, as while
      it gives a proper degree of permanency to the Magistrate, will reserve to
      the people, the right of election they will not or ought not frequently to
      part with.&mdash;I am of opinion that this may easily be done; and that
      with some amendments the propositions before the Committee will fully
      answer this end.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      No position appears to me more true than this; that the General Gov<sup>t</sup>
      cannot effectually exist without reserving to the States the possession of
      their local rights. They are the instruments upon which the Union must
      frequently depend for the support &amp; execution of their powers, however
      immediately operating upon the people, and not upon the States.

        <p class="indent">
          Yates&#39; report of the speech is meagre. The closing paragraph,
          apparently the part lacking in Madison&#39;s report, is:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent">
            "While we were dependent on the crown of Great Britain, it was in
            contemplation to form the whole into one; but it was found
            impracticable. No legislature could make good laws for the whole,
            nor can it now be done. It would necessarily place the power in the
            hands of the few nearest the seat of government. State governments
            must therefore remain, if you mean to prevent confusion. The general
            negative powers will support the general government. Upon these
            considerations, I am led to form the second branch differently from
            the report. These powers are important, and the number not too
            large, upon the principle of proportion. I have considered the
            subject with great attention; and I propose this plan (reads it),
            and if no better plan is proposed, I will then move its adoption."&mdash;Yates,

      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum, inclined to a compromise as to the rule of
      proportion. He thought there was some weight in the objections of the
      small States. If V<sup>a</sup> should have 16. votes &amp; Del<sup>re</sup>
      with several other States together 16, those from Virg<sup>a</sup> would
      be more likely to unite than the others, and would therefore have an undue
      influence. This remark was applicable not only to States, but to Counties
      or other districts of the same State. Accordingly the Constitution of Mass<sup>ts</sup>
      had provided that the representatives of the larger districts should not
      be in an exact ratio to their numbers, and experience he thought had shewn
      the provision to be expedient.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Read. The States have heretofore been in a sort of
      partnership. They ought to adjust their old affairs before they open a new
      account. He brought into view the appropriation of the com&#771;on
      interest in the Western lands, to the use of particular States. Let
      justice be done on this head; let the fund be applied fairly &amp; equally
      to the discharge of the general debt, and the smaller States who had been
      injured; would listen then perhaps to those ideas of just representation
      which had been held out.

      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum, did not see how the Convention could interpose in
      the case. Errors he allowed had been committed on the subject. But Cong<sup>s</sup>
      were now using their endeavours to rectify them. The best remedy would be
      such a Government as would have vigor enough to do justice throughout.
      This was certainly the best chance that could be afforded to the smaller
      States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson, the question is shall the members of the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch be chosen by the Legislatures of the States? When he considered the
      amazing extent of Country&mdash;the immense population which is to fill
      it, the influence which the Gov<sup>t</sup> we are to form will have, not
      only on the present generation of our people &amp; their multiplied
      posterity, but on the whole Globe, he was lost in the magnitude of the
      object. The project of Henry the 4<sup>th</sup> &amp; his Statesmen was
      but the picture in miniature of the great portrait to be exhibited. He was
      opposed to an election by the State Legislatures. In explaining his
      reasons it was necessary to observe the twofold relation in which the
      people would stand, 1. as Citizens of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      2. as Citizens of their particular State. The Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      was meant for them in the first capacity: the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> in
      the second. Both Gov<sup>ts</sup> were derived from the people&mdash;both
      meant for the people&mdash;both therefore ought to be regulated on the
      same principles. The same train of ideas which belonged to the relation of
      the Citizens to their State Gov<sup>ts</sup> were applicable to their
      relation to the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> and in forming the latter,
      we ought to proceed, by abstracting as much as possible from the idea of
      the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>. With respect to the province &amp; object of
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> they should be considered as having no
      existence. The election of the 2<sup>d</sup> branch by the Legislatures,
      will introduce &amp; cherish local interests &amp; local prejudices. The
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> is not an assemblage of States, but of
      individuals for certain political <span class="pagenum"><a name="page234"
      id="page234"></a>[pg&nbsp;234]</span> purposes&mdash;it is not meant for
      the States, but for the individuals composing them; the <i>individuals</i>
      therefore not the <i>States</i>, ought to be represented in it: A
      proportion in this representation can be preserved in the 2<sup>d</sup> as
      well as in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch; and the election can be made by
      electors chosen by the people for that purpose. He moved an amendment to
      that effect which was not seconded.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth saw no reason for departing from the mode
      contained in the Report. Whoever chooses the member, he will be a Citizen
      of the State he is to represent &amp; will feel the same spirit &amp; act
      the same part whether he be appointed by the people or the Legislature.
      Every State has its particular views &amp; prejudices, which will find
      their way into the general Councils, through whatever channel they may
      flow. Wisdom was one of the characteristics which it was in contemplation
      to give the second branch. Would not more of it issue from the
      Legislatures; than from an immediate election by the people. He urged the
      necessity of maintaining the existence, &amp; agency of the States.
      Without their co-operation it would be impossible to support a Republican
      Gov<sup>t</sup> over so great an extent of Country. An army could scarcely
      render it practicable. The largest States are the worst Governed. Virg<sup>a</sup>
      is obliged to acknowledge her incapacity to extend her Gov<sup>t</sup> to
      Kentuckey. Mass<sup>ts</sup> cannot keep the peace one hundred miles from
      her capitol and is now forming an army for its support. How long Pen<sup>a</sup>
      may be free from a like situation cannot be foreseen. If the principles
      &amp; materials of our Gov<sup>t</sup> are not adequate to the extent of
      these single States; how can it be imagined that they can support a single
      Gov<sup>t</sup> throughout the U. States. The only chance of supporting a
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> lies in grafting it on that of the
      individual States.

      Doc<sup>r</sup> Williamson professed himself a friend to such a system as
      would secure the existence of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>. The happiness of
      the people depended on it. He was at a loss to give his vote as to the
      Senate untill he knew the number of its members. In order to ascertain
      this, he moved to insert these words after "2<sup>d</sup> branch of the
      Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature"&mdash;"who shall bear such proportion to the
      n<sup>o</sup> of the 1<sup>st</sup> branch as 1 to &mdash;&mdash;." He was

      M<sup>r</sup> Mason. It has been agreed on all hands that an efficient Gov<sup>t</sup>
      is necessary that to render it such it ought to have the faculty of self
      defence, that to render its different branches effectual each of them
      ought to have the same power of self defence. He did not wonder that such
      an agreement should have prevailed in these points. He only wondered that
      there should be any disagreement about the necessity of allowing the State
      Gov<sup>ts</sup> the same self-defence. If they are to be preserved as he
      conceived to be essential, they certainly ought to have this power. And
      the only mode left of giving it to them, was by allowing them to appoint
      the 2<sup>d</sup> branch of the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature.

      they exercised their functions; and would in a little time be rather the
      representatives of that than of the State appoint<sup>g</sup> them.

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison. In order to judge of the form to be given to this
      institution, it will be proper to take a view of the ends to be served by
      it. These were first to protect the people ag<sup>st</sup> their rulers;
      secondly to protect the people ag<sup>st</sup> the transient impressions
      into which they themselves might be led. A people deliberating in a
      temperate moment, and with the experience of other nations before them, on
      the plan of Gov<sup>t</sup> most likely to secure their happiness, would
      first be aware, that those charg<sup>d</sup> with the public happiness
      might betray their trust. An obvious precaution ag<sup>st</sup> this
      danger w<sup>d</sup> be to divide the trust between different bodies of
      men, who might watch &amp; check each other. In this they w<sup>d</sup> be
      governed by the same prudence which has prevailed in organizing the
      subordinate departments of Gov<sup>t</sup>, where all business liable to
      abuses is made to pass thro&#39; separate hands, the one being a check on
      the other. It w<sup>d</sup> next occur to such people, that they
      themselves were liable to temporary errors, thro&#39; want of information
      as to their true interest, and that men chosen for a short term, &amp;
      employed but a small portion of that in public affairs, might err from the
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page239" id="page239"></a>[pg&nbsp;239]</span>
      same cause. This reflection w<sup>d</sup> naturally suggest that the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      be so constituted as that one of its branches might have an opp<sup>y</sup>
      of acquiring a competent knowledge of the public interests. Another
      reflection equally becoming a people on such an occasion, w<sup>d</sup> be
      that they themselves, as well as a numerous body of Representatives, were
      liable to err also, from fickleness and passion. A necessary fence ag<sup>st</sup>
      this danger would be to select a portion of enlightened citizens, whose
      limited number, and firmness might seasonably interpose ag<sup>st</sup>
      impetuous councils. It ought finally to occur to a people deliberating on
      a Gov<sup>t</sup> for themselves, that as different interests necessarily
      result from the liberty meant to be secured, the major interest might
      under sudden impulses be tempted to commit injustice on the minority. In
      all civilized Countries the people fall into different classes hav<sup>g</sup>
      a real or supposed difference of interests. There will be creditors &amp;
      debtors; farmers, merch<sup>ts</sup> &amp; manufacturers. There will be
      particularly the distinction of rich &amp; poor. It was true as had been
      observ<sup>d</sup> (by M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney) we had not among us those
      hereditary distinctions, of rank which were a great source of the contests
      in the ancient Gov<sup>ts</sup> as well as the modern States of Europe,
      nor those extremes of wealth or poverty which characterize the latter. We
      cannot however be regarded even at this time, as one homogeneous mass, in
      which every thing that affects a part will affect in the same manner the
      whole. In framing a system which we wish to last for ages, we sh<sup>d</sup>
      not lose sight of the changes which ages will produce. An increase of
      population will of necessity increase the proportion of those who will
      labour under all the hardships of life, &amp; secretly sigh for a more
      equal distribution of its blessings. These may in time outnumber those who
      are placed above the feelings of indigence. According to the equal laws of
      suffrage, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page240" id="page240"></a>[pg&nbsp;240]</span>
      the power will slide into the hands of the former. No agrarian attempts
      have yet been made in this Country, but symptoms, of a levelling spirit,
      as we have understood, have sufficiently appeared in certain quarters, to
      give notice of the future danger. How is this danger to be guarded ag<sup>st</sup>
      on the republican principles? How is the danger in all cases of interested
      coalitions to oppress the minority to be guarded ag<sup>st</sup>? Among
      other means by the establishment of a body in the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      sufficiently respectable for its wisdom &amp; virtue, to aid on such
      emergencies, the preponderance of justice by throwing its weight into that
      scale. Such being the objects of the second branch in the proposed Gov<sup>t</sup>
      he thought a considerable duration ought to be given to it. He did not
      conceive that the term of nine years could threaten any real danger; but
      in pursuing his particular ideas on the subject, he should require that
      the long term allowed to the 2<sup>d</sup> branch should not commence till
      such a period of life, as would render a perpetual disqualification to be
      re-elected little inconvenient either in a public or private view. He
      observed that as it was more than probable we were now digesting a plan
      which in its operation w<sup>d</sup> decide for ever the fate of
      Republican Gov<sup>t</sup> we ought not only to provide every guard to
      liberty that its preservation c<sup>d</sup> require, but be equally
      careful to supply the defects which our own experience had particularly
      pointed out.

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman. Gov<sup>t</sup> is instituted for those who live
      under it. It ought therefore to be so constituted as not to be dangerous
      to their liberties. The more permanency it has the worse if it be a bad
      Gov<sup>t</sup>. Frequent elections are necessary to preserve the good
      behavior of rulers. They also tend to give permanency to the Government,
      by preserving that good behavior, because it ensures their re-election. In
      Connecticut elections have been very frequent, yet great stability &amp;
      uniformity both as to persons <span class="pagenum"><a name="page241"
      id="page241"></a>[pg&nbsp;241]</span> &amp; measures have been experienced
      from its original establishm<sup>t</sup> to the present time; a period of
      more than a 130 years. He wished to have provision made for steadiness
      &amp; wisdom in the system to be adopted; but he thought six or four years
      would be sufficient. He sh<sup>d</sup> be content with either.

      M<sup>r</sup> Read wished it to be considered by the small States that it
      was their interest that we should become one people as much as possible;
      that State attachments sh<sup>d</sup> be extinguished as much as possible;
      that the Senate, sh<sup>d</sup> be so constituted as to have the feelings
      of Citizens of the whole.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Hamilton. He did not mean to enter particularly into the
      subject. He concurred with M<sup>r</sup> Madison in thinking we were now
      to decide forever the fate of Republican Government; and that if we did
      not give to that form due stability and wisdom, it would be disgraced
      &amp; lost among ourselves, disgraced &amp; lost to mankind forever. He
      acknowledged himself not to think favorably of Republican Government; but
      addressed his remarks to those who did think favorably of it, in order to
      prevail on them to tone their Government as high as possible. He professed
      himself to be as zealous an advocate for liberty as any man whatever, and
      trusted he should be as willing a martyr to it though he differed as to
      the form in which it was most eligible.&mdash;He concurred also in the
      general observations of (M<sup>r</sup> Madison) on the subject, which
      might be supported by others if it were necessary. It was certainly true
      that nothing like an equality of property existed; that an inequality
      would exist as long as liberty existed, and that it would unavoidably
      result from that very liberty itself. This inequality of property
      constituted the great &amp; fundamental distinction in Society. When the
      Tribunitial power had levelled the boundary between the <i>patricians</i>
      &amp; <i>plebeians</i>, what followed? The distinction <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page242" id="page242"></a>[pg&nbsp;242]</span>
      between rich &amp; poor was substituted. He meant not however to enlarge
      on the subject. He rose principally to remark that (M<sup>r</sup> Sherman)
      seemed not to recollect that one branch of the proposed Gov<sup>t</sup>
      was so formed, as to render it particularly the guardians of the poorer
      orders of Citizens; nor to have adverted to the true causes of the
      stability which had been exemplified in Con<sup>t</sup>. Under the British
      system as well as the federal, many of the great powers appertaining to
      Gov<sup>t</sup> particularly all those relating to foreign Nations were
      not in the hands of the Gov<sup>t</sup> there. Their internal affairs also
      were extremely simple, owing to sundry causes many of which were peculiar
      to that Country. Of late the Governm<sup>t</sup> had entirely given way to
      the people, and had in fact suspended many of its ordinary functions in
      order to prevent those turbulent scenes which had appeared elsewhere. He
      asks M<sup>r</sup> S. whether the State at this time dare impose &amp;
      collect a tax on y<sup>e</sup> people? To these causes &amp; not to the
      frequency of elections, the effect as far as it existed ought to be
      chiefly ascribed.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry, wished we could be united in our ideas concerning a
      permanent Gov<sup>t</sup>. All aim at the same end, but there are great
      differences as to the means. One circumstance He thought should be
      carefully attended to. There was not 1/1000 part of our fellow citizens
      who were not ag<sup>st</sup> every approach towards Monarchy. Will they
      ever agree to a plan which seems to make such an approach. The Convention
      ought to be extremely cautious in what they hold out to the people.
      Whatever plan may be proposed will be espoused with warmth by many out of
      respect to the quarter it proceeds from as well as from an approbation of
      the plan itself. And if the plan should be of such a nature as to rouse a
      violent opposition, it is easy to foresee that discord &amp; confusion
      will ensue, and it is even possible that we may <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page243" id="page243"></a>[pg&nbsp;243]</span> become a prey to
      foreign powers. He did not deny the position of M<sup>r</sup> Madison,
      that the majority will generally violate justice when they have an
      interest in so doing: But did not think there was any such temptation in
      this Country. Our situation was different from that of G. Britain; and the
      great body of lands yet to be parcelled out &amp; settled would very much
      prolong the difference. Notwithstanding the symptoms of injustice which
      had marked many of our public Councils, they had not proceeded so far as
      not to leave hopes, that there would be a sufficient sense of justice
      &amp; virtue for the purpose of Gov<sup>t</sup>. He admitted the evils
      arising from a frequency of elections; and would agree to give the Senate
      a duration of four or five years. A longer term would defeat itself. It
      never would be adopted by the people.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson did not mean to repeat what had fallen from others,
      but w<sup>d</sup> add an observation or two which he believed had not yet
      been suggested. Every nation may be regarded in two relations 1 to its own
      citizens. 2 to foreign nations. It is therefore not only liable to anarchy
      &amp; tyranny within, but has wars to avoid &amp; treaties to obtain from
      abroad. The Senate will probably be the depository of the powers
      concerning the latter objects. It ought therefore to be made respectable
      in the eyes of foreign Nations. The true reason why G. Britain has not yet
      listened to a commercial treaty with us has been, because she had no
      confidence in the stability or efficacy of our Government. 9 years with a
      rotation, will provide these desirable qualities; and give our Gov<sup>t</sup>
      an advantage in this respect over Monarchy itself. In a Monarchy much must
      always depend on the temper of the man. In such a body, the personal
      character will be lost in the political. He w<sup>d</sup> add another
      observation. The popular objection ag<sup>st</sup> appointing any public
      body for a long term was that it might <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page244" id="page244"></a>[pg&nbsp;244]</span> by gradual
      encroachments prolong itself first into a body for life, and finally
      become a hereditary one. It would be a satisfactory answer to this
      objection that as 1/3 would go out triennially, there would be always
      three divisions holding their places for unequal times, and consequently
      acting under the influence of different views, and different impulses.&mdash;On

      seemed to be proper for consideration. One important object in
      constituting the Senate was to secure the rights of property. To give them
      weight &amp; firmness for this purpose, a considerable duration in office
      was thought necessãy. But a longer term than 6 years, would be of no avail
      in this respect, if needy persons should be appointed. He suggested
      therefore the propriety of annexing to the office a qualification of

      merely to preserve the State Govern<sup>ts</sup> not to govern
      individuals: that its powers ought to be kept within narrow limits: that
      if too little power was given to it, more might be added; but that if too
      much, it could never be resumed: that individuals as such have little to
      do but with their own States; that the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> has
      no more to apprehend from the States composing the Union, while it pursues
      proper measures, that Gov<sup>t</sup> over individuals has to apprehend
      from its subjects: that to resort to the Citizens at large for their
      sanction to a new Govern<sup>t</sup> will be throwing them back into a
      state of Nature; that the dissolution of the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> is
      involved in the nature of the process; that the people have no right <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page249" id="page249"></a>[pg&nbsp;249]</span> to
      do this without the consent of those to whom they have delegated their
      power for State purposes: through their tongues only they can speak,
      through their ears, only can hear: that the States have shewn a good
      disposition to comply with the Acts of Cong<sup>s</sup>, weak,
      contemptibly weak as that body has been; and have failed through inability
      alone to comply: that the heaviness of the private debts, and the waste of
      property during the war, were the chief causes of this inability; that he
      did not conceive the instances mentioned by M<sup>r</sup> Madison of
      compacts between V<sup>a</sup> &amp; M<sup>d</sup> between P<sup>a</sup>
      &amp; N.&nbsp;J. or of troops raised by Mass<sup>ts</sup> for defence
      against the Rebels, to be violations of the articles of confederation&mdash;that
      an equal vote in each State was essential to the federal idea, and was
      founded in justice &amp; freedom, not merely in policy: that tho&#39; the
      States may give up this right of sovereignty, yet they had not, and ought
      not: that the States like individuals were in a State of nature equally
      sovereign &amp; free. In order to prove that individuals in a State of
      Nature are equally free &amp; independent he read passages from Locke,
      Vattel, Lord Summers&mdash;Priestly. To prove that the case is the same
      with States till they surrender their equal sovereignty, he read other
      passages in Locke &amp; Vattel, and also Rutherford: that the States being
      equal cannot treat or confederate so as to give up an equality of votes
      without giving up their liberty: that the propositions on the table were a
      system of slavery for 10 States: that as V<sup>a</sup> Mass<sup>ts</sup>
      &amp; P<sup>a</sup> have 42/90 of the votes they can do as they please
      without a miraculous Union of the other ten: that they will have nothing
      to do, but to gain over one of the ten to make them compleat masters of
      the rest; that they can then appoint an Execut<sup>e</sup> &amp; Judiciary
      &amp; legislate for them as they please: that there was &amp; would
      continue a natural predilection &amp; partiality in men for their own
      States; that the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page250" id="page250"></a>[pg&nbsp;250]</span>
      States, particularly the smaller, would never allow a negative to be
      exercised over their laws: that no State in Ratifying the Confederation
      had objected to the equality of votes; that the complaints at present run
      not ag<sup>st</sup> this equality but the want of power: that 16 members
      from V<sup>a</sup> would be more likely to act in concert than a like
      number formed of members from different States: that instead of a junction
      of the small States as a remedy, he thought a division of the large States
      would be more eligible.&mdash;This was the substance of a speech which was
      continued more than three hours. He was too much exhausted he said to

          gives Martin&#39;s speech more fully:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent">
            "On federal grounds, it is said, that a minority will govern a
            majority&mdash;but on the Virginia plan a minority would tax a
            majority. In a federal government, a majority of states must and
            ought to tax. In the local government of states, counties may be
            unequal&mdash;still numbers, not property, govern. What is the
            government now forming, over states or persons? As to the latter,
            their rights cannot be the object of a general government. These are
            already secured by their guardians, the state governments. The
            general government is therefore intended only to protect and guard
            the rights of the states as states.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "This general government, I believe, is the first upon earth which
            gives checks against democracies or aristocracies. The only
            necessary check in a general government ought to be a restraint to
            prevent its absorbing the powers of the state governments.
            Representation on federal principles can only flow from state
            societies. Representation and taxation are ever inseparable&mdash;not
            according to the quantum of property, but the quantum of freedom.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "Will the representatives of a state forget state interests? The
            mode of election cannot change it. These prejudices cannot be
            eradicated&mdash;Your general government cannot be just or equal
            upon the Virginia plan, unless you abolish state interests. If this
            cannot be done, you must go back to principles purely federal.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "On this latter ground, the state legislatures and their
            constituents will have no interests to pursue different from the
            general government, and both will be interested to support each
            other. Under these ideas can it be expected that the people can
            approve the Virginia plan? But it is said, the people, not the state
            legislatures, will be called upon for approbation&mdash;with an
            evident design to separate the interests of the governors from the
            governed. What must be the consequence? Anarchy and confusion. We
            lose the ideas of the powers with which we are intrusted. The
            legislatures must approve. By them it must, on your own plan, be
            laid before the people. How will such a government, over so many
            great states, operate. Wherever new settlements have been formed in
            large states, they immediately want to shake off their independency.
            Why? Because the government is too remote for their good. The people
            want it nearer home.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "The basis of all ancient and modern confederacies is the freedom
            and the independency of the states composing it. The states forming
            the amphictionic council were equal, though Lacedemon, one of the
            greatest states, attempted the exclusion of three of the lesser
            states from this right. The plan reported, it is true, only intends
            to diminish those rights, not to annihilate them&mdash;It was the
            ambition and power of the great Grecian states which at last ruined
            this respectable council. The states as societies are ever
            respectful. Has Holland or Switzerland ever complained of the
            equality of the states which compose their respective confederacies?
            Bern and Zurich are larger than the remaining eleven cantons&mdash;so
            of many of the states of Germany; and yet their governments are not
            complained of. Bern alone might usurp the whole power of the
            Helvetic confederacy, but she is contented still with being equal.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "The admission of the larger states into the confederation, on the
            principle of equality, is dangerous&mdash;But on the Virginia system
            it is ruinous and destructive. Still it is the true interest of all
            the states to confederate&mdash;It is their joint efforts which must
            protect and secure us from foreign danger, and give us peace and
            harmony at home.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "(Here Mr. Martin entered into a detail of the comparative powers of
            each state, and stated their probable weakness and strength.)
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "At the beginning of our troubles with Great Britain, the smaller
            states were attempted to be cajoled to submit to the views of that
            nation, lest the larger states should usurp their rights. We then
            answered them&mdash;your present plan is slavery, which on the
            remote prospect of a distant evil, we will not submit to.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "I would rather confederate with any single state, than submit to
            the Virginia plan. But we are already confederated, and no power on
            earth can dissolve it but by the consent of <i>all</i> the
            contracting powers&mdash;and four states, on this floor, have
            already declared their opposition to annihilate it. Is the old
            confederation dissolved, because some of the states wish a new
            confederation?"&mdash;Yates, <i>Secret Proceedings</i>, etc., 177.

      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson, thought that if any political truth could be
      grounded on mathematical demonstration, it was that if the States were
      equally sovereign now, and parted with equal proportions of sovereignty,
      that they would remain equally sovereign. He could not comprehend how the
      smaller States would be injured in the case, and wished some Gentleman
      would vouchsafe a solution of it. He observed that the small States, if
      they had a plurality of votes would have an interest in throwing the
      burdens off their own shoulders on those of the large ones. He begged that
      the expected addition of new States from the Westward might be kept in
      view. They would be small States, they would be poor States, they would be
      unable to pay in proportion to their numbers; their distance from market
      rendering the produce of their labour less valuable; they would
      consequently be tempted to combine for the purpose of laying burdens on
      comm&#771;erce &amp; consumption which would fall with greatest weight on
      the old States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, s<sup>d</sup> he was much disposed to concur in any
      expedient not inconsistent with fundamental principles, that could remove
      the difficulty concerning the rule of representation. But he could neither
      be convinced that the rule contended for was just, nor necessary for the
      safety of the small States ag<sup>st</sup> the large States. That it was
      not just, had been conceded by M<sup>r</sup> Breerly &amp; M<sup>r</sup>
      Paterson themselves. The expedient proposed by them was a new partition of
      the territory of the U. States. The fallacy of the reasoning drawn from
      the equality of Sovereign States in the formation of compacts, lay in
      confounding together mere Treaties, in which were specified certain duties
      to which the parties were to be bound, and certain rules by which their
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page254" id="page254"></a>[pg&nbsp;254]</span>
      subjects were to be reciprocally governed in their intercourse, with a
      compact by which an authority was created paramount to the parties, &amp;
      making laws for the government of them. If France, England &amp; Spain
      were to enter into a Treaty for the regulation of commerce &amp;c with the
      Prince of Monacho &amp; 4 or 5 other of the smallest sovereigns of Europe,
      they would not hesitate to treat as equals, and to make the regulations
      perfectly reciprocal. W<sup>d</sup> the case be the same, if a Council
      were to be formed of deputies from each with authority and discretion, to
      raise money, levy troops, determine the value of coin &amp;c? Would 30 or
      40, million of people submit their fortunes into the hands of a few
      thousands? If they did it would only prove that they expected more from
      the terror of their superior force, than they feared from the selfishness
      of their feeble associates. Why are Counties of the Same States
      represented in proportion to their numbers? Is it because the
      representatives are chosen by the people themselves? So will be the
      representatives in the Nation<sup>l</sup> Legislature. Is it because, the
      larger have more at stake than the smaller? The Case will be the same with
      the larger &amp; smaller States. Is it because the laws are to operate
      immediately on their persons &amp; properties? The same is the case in
      some degree as the articles of confederation stand; the same will be the
      case in a far greater degree, under the plan proposed to be substituted.
      In the cases of captures, of piracies, and of offences in a federal army,
      the property &amp; persons of individuals depend on the laws of Cong<sup>s</sup>.
      By the plan proposed a compleat power of taxation, the highest prerogative
      of supremacy is proposed to be vested in the National Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      Many other powers are added which assimilate it to the Gov<sup>t</sup> of
      individual States. The negative proposed on the State laws, will make it
      an essential branch of the State Legislatures &amp; of course will <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page255" id="page255"></a>[pg&nbsp;255]</span>
      require that it should be exercised by a body established on like
      principles with the other branches of those Legislatures.&mdash;That it is
      not necessãy to secure the small States ag<sup>st</sup> the large ones he
      conceived to be equally obvious: Was a combination of the large ones
      dreaded? This must arise either from some interest common to V<sup>a</sup>
      Mass<sup>ts</sup> &amp; P<sup>a</sup> &amp; distinguishing them from the
      other States, or from the mere circumstance of similarity of size. Did any
      such common interest exist? In point of situation they could not have been
      more effectually separated from each other by the most jealous citizen of
      the most jealous State. In point of manners, Religion, and the other
      circumstances which sometimes beget affection between different
      communities, they were not more assimilated than the other States&mdash;In
      point of the staple productions they were as dissimilar as any three other
      States in the Union. The Staple of Mass<sup>ts</sup> was <i>fish</i>, of P<sup>a</sup>
      <i>flower</i>, of V<sup>a</sup> <i>Tob<sup>o</sup></i> Was a Combination
      to be apprehended from the mere circumstance of equality of size?
      Experience suggested no such danger. The journals of Cong<sup>s</sup> did
      not present any peculiar association of these States in the votes
      recorded. It had never been seen that different Counties in the same
      State, conformable in extent, but disagreeing in other circumstances,
      betrayed a propensity to such combinations. Experience rather taught a
      contrary lesson. Among individuals of superior eminence &amp; weight in
      Society, rivalships were much more frequent than coalitions. Among
      independent Nations, pre-eminent over their neighbours, the same remark
      was verified. Carthage &amp; Rome tore one another to pieces instead of
      uniting their forces to devour the weaker nations of the Earth. The Houses
      of Austria &amp; France were hostile as long as they remained the greatest
      powers of Europe. England &amp; France have succeeded to the pre-eminence
      &amp; to the enmity. To this principle we <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page256" id="page256"></a>[pg&nbsp;256]</span> owe perhaps our
      liberty. A coalition between those powers would have been fatal to us.
      Among the principal members of antient &amp; Modern confederacies, we find
      the same effect from the same cause. The contentions, not the Coalitions
      of Sparta, Athens &amp; Thebes, proved fatal to the smaller members of the
      Amphyctionic Confederacy. The contentions, not the combinations of Prussia
      &amp; Austria, have distracted &amp; oppressed the German empire. Were the
      large States formidable <i>singly</i> to their smaller neighbours? On this
      supposition the latter ought to wish for such a General Gov<sup>t</sup> as
      will operate with equal energy on the former as on themselves. The more
      lax the band, the more liberty the larger will have to avail themselves of
      their superior force. Here again Experience was an instructive monitor.
      What is y<sup>e</sup> situation of the weak compared with the strong in
      those stages of civilization in which the violence of individuals is least
      controuled by an efficient Government? The Heroic period of Antient
      Greece, the feudal licentiousness of the middle ages of Europe, the
      existing condition of the American Savages, answer this question. What is
      the situation of the minor sovereigns in the great society of independent
      nations, in which the more powerful are under no controul but the nominal
      authority of the law of Nations? Is not the danger to the former exactly
      in proportion to their weakness. But there are cases still more in point.
      What was the condition of the weaker members of the Amphyctionic
      Confederacy. Plutarch (life of Themistocles) will inform us that it
      happened but too often that the strongest cities corrupted &amp; awed the
      weaker, and that Judgment went in favor of the more powerful party. What
      is the condition of the lesser states in the German Confederacy? We all
      know that they are exceedingly trampled upon: and that they owe their
      safety as far as they enjoy it, partly to their enlisting themselves,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page257" id="page257"></a>[pg&nbsp;257]</span>
      under the rival banners of the pre-eminent members, partly to alliances
      with neighbouring Princes which the Constitution of the Empire does not
      prohibit. What is the state of things in the lax system of the Dutch
      Confederacy? Holland contains about 1/2 the People, supplies about 1/2 of
      the money, and by her influence, silently &amp; indirectly governs the
      whole republic. In a word; the two extremes before us are a perfect
      separation &amp; a perfect incorporation, of the 13 States. In the first
      case they would be independent nations subject to no law, but the law of
      nations. In the last, they would be mere counties of one entire republic,
      subject to one common law. In the first case the smaller States would have
      every thing to fear from the larger. In the last they would have nothing
      to fear. The true policy of the small States therefore lies in promoting
      those principles &amp; that form of Gov<sup>t</sup> which will most
      approximate the States to the condition of counties. Another consideration
      may be added. If the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> be feeble, the large
      States distrusting its continuance, and foreseeing that their importance
      &amp; security may depend on their own size &amp; strength, will never
      submit to a partition. Give to the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      sufficient energy &amp; permanency, &amp; you remove the objection.
      Gradual partitions of the large, &amp; junctions of the small States will
      be facilitated, and time may effect that equalization, which is wished for
      by the small States now, but can never be accomplished at once.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. The leading argument of those who contend for
      equality of votes among the States is that the States as such being equal,
      and being represented not as districts of individuals, but in their
      political &amp; corporate capacities, are entitled to an equality of
      suffrage. According to this mode of reasoning the representation of the
      boroughs in Engl[~d] which has been allowed on all hands to be the rotten

      the States represented in their corporate capacity like the States
      therefore they are entitled to equal voices, old Sarum to as many as
      London. And instead of the injury supposed hitherto to be done to London,
      the true ground of Complaint lies with old Sarum: for London instead of
      two which is her proper share, sends four representatives to Parliament.<a

      man; but how they may be most equally &amp; effectually guarded in
      Society. And if some give up more than others in order to obtain this end,
      there can be no room for complaint. To do otherwise, to require an equal

          representation will ever produce it. In the United Netherlands,
          Holland governs the whole, although she has only one vote. The

      on almost every question, several of the last producing as many noes as

      In this situation of this Assembly, groping as it were in the dark to find
      political truth, and scarce able to distinguish it when presented to us,
      how has it happened, Sir, that we have not hitherto once thought of humbly

      beginning of the Contest with G. Britain, when we were sensible of danger
      we had daily prayer in this room for the divine protection.&mdash;Our
      prayers, Sir, were heard, &amp; they were graciously answered. All of us
      who were engaged in the struggle must have observed frequent instances of
      a superintending providence in our favor. To that kind providence we owe
      this happy opportunity of consulting in peace on the means of establishing
      our future national felicity. And have we now forgotten that powerful
      friend? or do we imagine that we no longer need his assistance? I have
      lived, Sir, a long time, and the longer I live, the more convincing proofs

      an empire can rise without his aid? We have been assured, Sir, in the
      sacred writings that "except the Lord build the House they labour in vain
      that build it." I firmly believe this; and I also believe that without his
      concurring aid we shall succeed in this political building no better than
      the Builders of Babel: We shall be divided by our little partial local
      interests; our projects will be confounded, and we ourselves shall become
      a reproach and bye word down to future ages. And what is worse, mankind

      Doc<sup>r</sup> Johnson. The controversy must be endless whilst Gentlemen
      differ in the grounds of their arguments; Those on one side considering
      the States as districts of people composing one political Society; those
      on the other considering them as so many political societies. The fact is
      that the States do exist as political Societies, and a Gov<sup>t</sup> is
      to be formed for them in their political capacity, as well as for the
      individuals composing them. Does it not seem to follow, that if the States
      as such are to exist they must be armed with some power of self-defence.
      This is the idea of (Col. Mason) who appears to have looked to the bottom
      of this matter. Besides the aristocratic and other interests, which ought
      to have the means of defending themselves, the States have their interests
      as such, and are equally entitled to like means. On the whole he thought
      that as in some respects the States are to be considered in their
      political capacity, and in others as districts of individual citizens the
      two ideas embraced on different sides, instead of being opposed to each
      other, ought to be combined; that in <i>one</i> branch the <i>people</i>,
      ought to be represented, in the <i>other</i> the <i>States</i>.

      M<sup>r</sup> Ghoram. The States as now confederated have no doubt a right
      to refuse to be consolidated, or to be formed into any new system. But he
      wished the small States which seemed most ready to object, to consider
      which are to give up most, they or the larger ones. He conceived that a
      rupture of the Union w<sup>d</sup> be an event unhappy for all, but surely
      the large States would be least unable to take care of themselves, and to
      make connections with one another. The weak therefore were most interested
      in establishing some general system for maintaining order. If among
      individuals, composed partly of weak, and partly of strong, the former
      most need the protection of law &amp; Government, the case is exactly the
      same with weak &amp; powerful States. What would be the situation of
      Delaware (for these things he found must be spoken out, &amp; it might as
      well be done at first as last) what w<sup>d</sup> be the situation of
      Delaware in case of a separation of the States? Would she not be at the
      mercy of Pennsylvania? would not her true interest lie in being
      consolidated with her, and ought she not now to wish for such a union with
      P<sup>a</sup> under one Gov<sup>t</sup> as will put it out of the power of
      Pen<sup>a</sup> to oppress her? Nothing can be more ideal than the danger
      apprehended by the States from their being formed into one nation. Mass<sup>ts</sup>
      was originally three colonies, viz old Mass<sup>ts</sup> Plymouth&mdash;&amp;
      the province of Mayne. These apprehensions existed then. An incorporation
      took place; all parties were safe &amp; satisfied; and every distinction
      is now forgotten. The case was similar with Connecticut &amp; New haven.
      The dread of Union was reciprocal; the consequence of it equally salutary
      and satisfactory. In like manner N.&nbsp;Jersey has been made one society
      out of two parts. Should a separation of the States take place, the fate
      of N.&nbsp;Jersey w<sup>d</sup> be worst of all. She has no foreign
      commerce &amp; can have but little. P<sup>a</sup> &amp; N.&nbsp;York will
      continue to levy taxes on <span class="pagenum"><a name="page263"
      id="page263"></a>[pg&nbsp;263]</span> her consumption. If she consults her
      interest she w<sup>d</sup> beg of all things to be annihilated. The
      apprehensions of the small States ought to be appeased by another
      reflection Mass<sup>ts</sup> will be divided. The province of Maine is
      already considered as approaching the term of its annexation to it; and P<sup>a</sup>
      will probably not increase, considering the present state of her
      population, &amp; other events that may happen. On the whole he considered
      a Union of the States as necessary to their happiness, &amp; a firm Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> as necessary to their Union. He sh<sup>d</sup> consider it
      as his duty if his colleagues viewed the matter in the same light he did
      to stay here as long as any other State would remain with them, in order
      to agree on some plan that could with propriety be recommended to the
      people.

      M<sup>r</sup> Read. He sh<sup>d</sup> have no objection to the system if
      it were truly national, but it has too much of a federal mixture in it.
      The little States he thought had not much to fear. He suspected that the
      large States felt their want of energy, &amp; wished for a Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> to supply the defect. Mass<sup>ts</sup> was evidently
      labouring under her weakness and he believed Delaware w<sup>d</sup> not be
      in much danger if in her neighbourhood. Delaware had enjoyed tranquillity
      &amp; he flattered himself w<sup>d</sup> continue to do so. He was not
      however so selfish as not to wish for a good Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      In order to obtain one the whole States must be incorporated. If the
      States remain, the representatives of the large ones will stick together,
      and carry everything before them. The Executive also will be chosen under
      the influence of this partiality, and will betray it in his
      administration. These jealousies are inseparable from the scheme of
      leaving the States in existence. They must be done away. The ungranted
      lands also which have been assumed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page264"

      table.

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison agreed with Doc<sup>r</sup> Johnson, that the mixed
      nature of the Gov<sup>t</sup> ought to be kept in view; but thought too
      much stress was laid on the rank of the States as political societies.
      There was a gradation, he observed from the smallest corporation, with the
      most limited powers, to the largest empire with the most perfect
      sovereignty. He pointed out the limitations on the sovereignty of the
      States, as now confederated their laws in relation to the paramount law of
      the Confederacy were analagous to that of bye laws to the supreme law
      within a State. Under the proposed Gov<sup>t</sup> the powers of the
      States will be much farther reduced. According to the views of every
      member, the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> will have powers far beyond
      those exercised by the British Parliament, when the States were part of
      the British Empire. It will in particular have the power, without the
      consent of the State Legislatures, to levy money directly on the people
      themselves; and therefore not to divest such <i>unequal</i> portions of
      the people as composed the several States, of an <i>equal</i> voice, would
      subject the system to the reproaches &amp; evils which have resulted from
      the vicious representation in G. B.

      He entreated the gentlemen representing the small States to renounce a
      principle w<sup>ch</sup> was confessedly unjust, which c<sup>d</sup> never
      be admitted, &amp; if admitted must infuse mortality into a Constitution
      which we wished to last forever. He prayed them to ponder well the
      consequences of suffering the Confederacy to go to pieces. It had been s<sup>d</sup>
      that the want of energy in the large states w<sup>d</sup> be a security to
      the small. It was forgotten that this want of energy proceeded from the
      supposed security of the States <span class="pagenum"><a name="page265"
      id="page265"></a>[pg&nbsp;265]</span> ag<sup>st</sup> all external danger.
      Let each state depend on itself for its security, &amp; let apprehensions
      arise of danger, from distant powers or from neighbouring States, &amp;
      the languishing condition of all the States, large as well as small, w<sup>d</sup>
      soon be transformed into vigorous &amp; high toned Gov<sup>ts</sup>. His
      great fear was that their Gov<sup>ts</sup> w<sup>d</sup> then have too
      much energy, that these might not only be formidable in the large to the
      small States, but fatal to the internal liberty of all. The same causes
      which have rendered the old world the Theatre of incessant wars, &amp;
      have banished liberty from the face of it, w<sup>d</sup> soon produce the
      same effects here. The weakness &amp; jealousy of the small States w<sup>d</sup>
      quickly introduce some regular military force ag<sup>st</sup> sudden
      danger from their powerful neighbours. The example w<sup>d</sup> be
      followed by others, and w<sup>d</sup> soon become universal. In time of
      actual war, great discretionary powers are constantly given to the
      Executive Magistrate. Constant apprehension of war, has the same tendency
      to render the head too large for the body. A standing military force, with
      an overgrown Executive will not long be safe companions to liberty. The
      means of defence ag<sup>st</sup> foreign danger, have been always the
      instruments of tyranny at home. Among the Romans it was a standing maxim
      to excite a war, whenever a revolt was apprehended. Throughout all Europe,
      the armies kept up under the pretext of defending, have enslaved the
      people. It is perhaps questionable, whether the best concerted system of
      absolute power in Europe c<sup>d</sup> maintain itself, in a situation,
      where no alarms of external danger c<sup>d</sup> tame the people to the
      domestic yoke. The insular situation of G. Britain was the principal cause
      of her being an exception to the general fate of Europe. It has rendered
      less defence necessary, and admitted a kind of defence w<sup>ch</sup> c<sup>d</sup>
      not be used for the purpose of oppression.&mdash;These consequences he
      conceived ought to be apprehended <span class="pagenum"><a name="page266"

      observed that individuals forming political Societies modify their rights
      differently with regard to suffrage. Examples of it are found in all the
      States. In all of them some individuals are deprived of the right
      altogether, not having the requisite qualification of property. In some of
      the States the right of suffrage is allowed in some cases and refused in
      others. To vote for a member in one branch, a certain quantum of property,
      to vote for a member in another branch of the Legislature, a higher
      quantum of property is required. In like manner States may modify their
      right of suffrage differently, the larger exercising a larger, the smaller
      a smaller share of it. But as States are a collection of individual men
      which ought we to respect most, the rights of the people composing them,
      or of the artificial beings resulting from the composition. Nothing could
      be more preposterous or absurd than to sacrifice the former to the latter.
      It has been s<sup>d</sup> that if the smaller States renounce their <i>equality</i>,
      they renounce at the same time their <i>liberty</i>. The truth is it is a
      contest for power, not for liberty. Will the men composing the small
      States be less free than those composing the larger. The State of Delaware
      having 40,000 souls will <i>lose power</i>, if she has 1/10 only of the
      votes allowed to P<sup>a</sup> having 400,000: but will the people of Del:
      <i>be less free</i>, if each citizen has an equal vote with each citizen
      of P<sup>a</sup> He admitted that common residence within the same State
      would produce a certain degree of attachment; and that this principle
      might have a certain influence <span class="pagenum"><a name="page267"
      id="page267"></a>[pg&nbsp;267]</span> in public affairs. He thought
      however that this might by some precautions be in a great measure
      excluded: and that no material inconvenience could result from it, as
      there could not be any ground for combination among the States whose
      influence was most dreaded. The only considerable distinction of
      interests, lay between the carrying &amp; non-carrying States, which
      divides instead of uniting the largest States. No considerable
      inconvenience had been found from the division of the State of N.&nbsp;York
      into different districts of different sizes.

      Some of the consequences of a dissolution of the Union, and the

      with different rival &amp; hostile nations of Europes, who will foment
      disturbances among ourselves, and make us parties to all their own
      quarrels. Foreign Nations having American dominion are &amp; must be

      foreign Nations was not the object at which we aimed; that the proper

      This was an ideal distinction. No Government could give us tranquillity
      &amp; happiness at home, which did not possess sufficient stability and
      strength to make us respectable abroad. This was the critical moment for
      forming such a Government. We should run every risk in trusting to future
      amendments. As yet we retain the habits of union. We are weak &amp;
      sensible of our weakness. Henceforward the motives will become feebler,

      M<sup>r</sup> Pierce considered the equality of votes under the
      Confederation as the great source of the public difficulties. The members
      of Cong<sup>s</sup> were advocates for local advantages. State
      distinctions must be sacrificed as far as the general good required, but
      without destroying the States. Tho&#39; from a small State he felt himself

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry, urged that we never were independent States, were not
      such now, &amp; never could be even on the principles of the
      Confederation. The States &amp; the advocates for them were intoxicated
      with the idea of their <i>sovereignty</i>. He was a member of Congress at
      the time the federal articles were formed. The injustice of allowing each
      State an equal vote was long insisted on. He voted for it, but it was ag<sup>st</sup>
      his Judgment, and under the pressure of public danger, and the obstinacy
      of the lesser States. The present Confederation he considered as
      dissolving. The fate of the Union will be decided by the Convention. If
      they do not agree on something, few delegates will probably be appointed
      to Cong<sup>s</sup>. If they do Cong<sup>s</sup> will probably be kept up
      till the new System should be adopted. He lamented that instead of coming
      here like a band of brothers, belonging to the same family, we seemed to
      have brought with us the spirit of political negotiators.

      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth moved that the rule of suffrage in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch be the same with that established by the articles of Confederation.
      "He was not sorry on the whole he said that the vote just passed, had
      determined against this rule in the first branch. He hoped it would become
      a ground of compromise with regard to the 2<sup>d</sup> branch. We were
      partly national; partly federal. The proportional representation in the
      first branch was conformable to the national principle &amp; would secure
      the large States ag<sup>st</sup> the small. An equality of voices was
      conformable to the federal principle and was necessary to secure the Small
      States ag<sup>st</sup> the large. He trusted that on this middle ground a
      compromise would take place. He did not see that it could on any other.
      And if no compromise should take place, our meeting would not only be in
      vain but worse than in vain. To the Eastward he was sure Mass<sup>ts</sup>
      was the only State that would listen to a proposition for excluding the
      States as equal political Societies, from an equal voice in both branches.
      The others would risk every consequence rather than part with so dear a
      right. An attempt to deprive them of it, was at once cutting the body of
      America in two, and as he supposed would be the case, somewhere about this
      part of it. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page270" id="page270"></a>[pg&nbsp;270]</span>
      The large States he conceived would notwithstanding the equality of votes,
      have an influence that would maintain their superiority. Holland, as had
      been admitted (by M<sup>r</sup> Madison) had, notwithstanding a like
      equality in the Dutch Confederacy, a prevailing influence in the public
      measures. The power of self defence was essential to the small States.
      Nature had given it to the smallest insect of the creation. He could never
      admit that there was no danger of combinations among the large States.
      They will like individuals find out and avail themselves of the advantage
      to be gained by it. It was true the danger would be greater if they were
      contiguous and had a more immediate common interest. A defensive
      combination of the small States was rendered more difficult by their great
      number. He would mention another consideration of great weight. The
      existing confederation was founded on the equality of the States in the
      article of suffrage: was it meant to pay no regard to this antecedent
      plighted faith. Let a strong Executive, a Judiciary &amp; Legislative
      power be created, but Let not too much be attempted; by which all may be
      lost. He was not in general a half-way man, yet he preferred doing half
      the good we could, rather than do nothing at all. The other half may be
      added, when the necessity shall be more fully experienced.<a

            framing a system of government. The difficulty of getting its
            defects amended are great and sometimes insurmountable. The Virginia
            state government was the first which was made, and though its
            defects are evident to every person, we cannot get it amended. The
            Dutch have made four several attempts to amend their system without
            success. The few alterations made in it were by tumult and faction,
            and for the worse. If there was real danger, I would give the
            smaller states the defensive weapons&mdash;But there is none from
            that quarter. The great danger to our general government is the
            great southern and northern interests of the continent, being
            opposed to each other. Look to the votes in congress, and most of
            them stand divided by the geography of the country, not according to
            the size of the states.

          <p class="indent">
            "Suppose the first branch granted money, may not the second branch,
            from state views, counteract the first? In congress, the single
            state of Delaware prevented an embargo, at the time that all the
            other states thought it absolutely necessary for the support of the

      The motion of M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth resumed for allowing each State an
      equal vote in y<sup>e</sup> 2<sup>d</sup> branch.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson did not expect such a motion after the establishment
      of y<sup>e</sup> contrary principle in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch; and
      considering the reasons which would oppose it, even if an equal vote had
      been allowed in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch. The Gentleman from Connecticut
      (M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth) had pronounced that if the motion should not be
      acceded to, of all the States North of Pen<sup>a</sup> one only would
      agree to any Gen<sup>l</sup> Government. He entertained more favorable
      hopes of Conn<sup>t</sup> and of the other Northern States. He hoped the
      alarms exceeded their cause, and that they would not abandon a Country to
      which they were bound by so many strong and endearing ties. But should the
      deplored event happen, it would neither stagger his sentiments nor his
      duty. If the minority of the people of America refuse to coalesce with the
      majority on just and proper principles, if a separation must take place,
      it could never happen on better grounds. The votes of yesterday ag<sup>st</sup>
      the just principle of representation, were as 22 to 90 of the people of
      America. Taking the opinions to be the same on this point, and he was sure
      if there was any room for change, it could not be on the side of the
      majority, the question will be shall less than 1/4 of the U. States
      withdraw themselves from the Union; or shall more than 3/4 renounce the
      inherent, indisputable and unalienable rights of men, in favor of the
      artificial systems of States. If issue must be joined, it was on this
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page274" id="page274"></a>[pg&nbsp;274]</span>
      point he would chuse to join it. The Gentleman from Connecticut in
      supposing that the preponderancy secured to the majority in the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch had removed the objections to an equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch for the security of the minority, narrowed the case extremely. Such
      an equality will enable the minority to controul in all cases whatsoever,
      the sentiments and interests of the majority. Seven States will controul
      six: Seven States, according to the estimates that had been used, composed
      24/90 of the whole people. It would be in the power then of less than 1/3
      to overrule 2/3 whenever a question should happen to divide the States in
      that manner. Can we forget for whom we are forming a Government? Is it for
      <i>men</i>, or for the imaginary beings called <i>States</i>? Will our
      honest Constituents be satisfied with metaphysical distinctions? Will
      they, ought they to be satisfied with being told, that the one-third
      compose the greater number of States? The rule of suffrage ought on every
      principle to be the same in the 2<sup>d</sup> as in the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch. If the Government be not laid on this foundation, it can be
      neither solid nor lasting. Any other principle will be local, confined
      &amp; temporary. This will expand with the expansion, and grow with the
      growth of the U. States.&mdash;Much has been said of an imaginary
      combination of three States. Sometimes a danger of monarchy, sometimes of
      aristocracy has been charged on it. No explanation however of the danger
      has been vouchsafed. It would be easy to prove both from reason &amp;
      history that rivalships would be more probable than coalitions; and that
      there are no coinciding interests that could produce the latter. No answer
      has yet been given to the observations of (M<sup>r</sup> Madison) on this
      subject. Should the Executive Magistrate be taken from one of the large
      States would not the other two be thereby thrown into the scale with the
      other States? Whence then the danger <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page275" id="page275"></a>[pg&nbsp;275]</span> of monarchy? Are the
      people of the three large States more aristocratic than those of the small
      ones? Whence then the danger of aristocracy from their influence? It is
      all a mere illusion of names. We talk of States, till we forget what they
      are composed of. Is a real &amp; fair majority, the natural hot-bed of
      aristocracy? It is a part of the definition of this species of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      or rather of tyranny, that the smaller number governs the greater. It is
      true that a majority of States in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch cannot carry a
      law ag<sup>st</sup> a majority of the people in the 1<sup>st</sup>. But
      this removes half only of the objection. Bad Govern<sup>ts</sup> are of
      two sorts. 1. that which does too little. 2. that which does too much:
      that which fails thro&#39; weakness; and that which destroys thro&#39;
      oppression. Under which of these evils do the U. States at present groan?
      Under the weakness and inefficiency of its Govern<sup>t</sup>. To remedy
      this weakness we have been sent to this Convention. If the motion should
      be agreed to, we shall leave the U. S.&nbsp;fettered precisely as
      heretofore; with the additional mortification of seeing the good purposes
      of y<sup>e</sup> fair representation of the people in the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch, defeated in the 2<sup>d</sup>. Twenty four will still controul
      sixty six. He lamented that such a disagreement should prevail on the
      point of representation, as he did not foresee that it would happen on the
      other point most contested, the boundary between the Gen<sup>l</sup> &amp;
      the local authorities. He thought the States necessary &amp; valuable
      parts of a good system.

      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth. The capital objection of M<sup>r</sup> Wilson,
      "that the minority will rule the majority" is not true. The power is given
      to the few to save them from being destroyed by the many. If an equality
      of votes had been given to them in both branches, the objection might have
      had weight. Is it a novel thing that the few should have a check on the
      many? Is it not the case in the British Constitution the <span

      wisdom of which so many gentlemen have united in applauding? Have not the
      House of Lords, who form so small a proportion of the nation a negative on
      the laws, as a necessary defence of their peculiar rights ag<sup>st</sup>
      the encroachm<sup>ts</sup> of the Commons. No instance of a Confederacy
      has existed in which an equality of voices has not been exercised by the
      members of it. We are running from one extreme to another. We are razing
      the foundations of the building, when we need only repair the roof. No
      salutary measure has been lost for want of <i>a majority of the States</i>,
      to favor it. If security be all that the great States wish for the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch secures them. The danger of combinations among them is not
      imaginary. Altho&#39; no particular abuses could be foreseen by him, the
      possibility of them would be sufficient to alarm him. But he could easily
      conceive cases in which they might result from such combinations. Suppose
      that in pursuance of some commercial treaty or arrangement, three or four
      free ports &amp; no more were to be established would not combinations be
      formed in favor of Boston&mdash;Philad<sup>a</sup> &amp; some port of the
      Chesapeak? A like concert might be formed in the appointment of the Great
      officers. He appealed again to the obligations of the federal pact which
      was still in force, and which had been entered into with so much
      solemnity; persuading himself that some regard would still be paid to the
      plighted faith under which each State small as well as great, held an
      equal right of suffrage in the general Councils. His remarks were not the
      result of partial or local views. The State he represented (Connecticut)
      held a middle rank.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison did justice to the able and close reasoning of M<sup>r</sup>
      E. but must observe that it did not always accord with itself. On another
      occasion, the large States were described by him as the Aristocratic
      States, ready to oppress the small. Now the Small <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page277" id="page277"></a>[pg&nbsp;277]</span> are the House of
      Lords requiring a negative to defend them ag<sup>st</sup> the more
      numerous Commons. M<sup>r</sup> E. had also erred in saying that no
      instance had existed in which confederated States had not retained to
      themselves a perfect equality of suffrage. Passing over the German system
      in which the K. of Prussia has nine voices, he reminded M<sup>r</sup> E.
      of the Lycian Confederacy, in which the component members had votes
      proportioned to their importance, and which Montesquieu recommends as the
      fittest model for that form of Government. Had the fact been as stated by
      M<sup>r</sup> E. it would have been of little avail to him, or rather
      would have strengthened the arguments ag<sup>st</sup> him; the History
      &amp; fate of the several confederacies modern as well as Antient,
      demonstrating some radical vice in their structure. In reply to the appeal
      of M<sup>r</sup> E. to the faith plighted in the existing federal compact,
      he remarked that the party claiming from others an adherence to a common
      engagement ought at least to be guiltless itself of a violation. Of all
      the States however Connecticut was perhaps least able to urge this plea.
      Besides the various omissions to perform the stipulated acts from which no
      State was free, the Legislature of that State had by a pretty recent vote,
      <i>positively refused</i> to pass a law for complying with the
      Requisitions of Cong<sup>s</sup>, and had transmitted a copy of the vote
      to Cong<sup>s</sup>. It was urged, he said, continually that an equality
      of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch was not only necessary to secure the
      small, but would be perfectly safe to the large ones whose majority in the
      1<sup>st</sup> branch was an effectual bulwark. But notwithstanding this
      apparent defence, the majority of States might still injure the majority
      of people. 1. they could <i>obstruct</i> the wishes and interests of the
      majority. 2. they could <i>extort</i> measures repugnant to the wishes
      &amp; interest of the Majority. 3. they could <i>impose</i> measures
      adverse thereto; as the 2<sup>d</sup> <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page278" id="page278"></a>[pg&nbsp;278]</span> branch will prob[~l]y
      exercise some great powers, in which the 1<sup>st</sup> will not
      participate. He admitted that every peculiar interest whether in any class
      of Citizens, or any description of States, ought to be secured as far as
      possible. Wherever there is danger of attack there ought to be given a
      Constitutional power of defence. But he contended that the States were
      divided into different interests not by their difference of size, but by
      other circumstances; the most material of which resulted partly from
      climate, but principally from the effects of their having or not having
      slaves. These two causes concurred in forming the great division of
      interests in the U. States. It did not lie between the large &amp; small
      States: It lay between the Northern &amp; Southern. And if any defensive
      power were necessary, it ought to be mutually given to these two
      interests. He was so strongly impressed with this important truth that he
      had been casting about in his mind for some expedient that would answer
      the purpose. The one which had occurred was that instead of proportioning
      the votes of the States in both branches, to their respective numbers of
      inhabitants computing the slaves in the ratio of 5 to 3, they should be
      represented in one branch according to the number of free inhabitants
      only; and in the other according to the whole n<sup>o</sup> counting the
      slaves as free. By this arrangement the Southern Scale would have the
      advantage in one House, and the Northern in the other. He had been
      restrained from proposing this expedient by two considerations: one was
      his unwillingness to urge any diversity of interests on an occasion where
      it is but too apt to arise of itself&mdash;the other was, the inequality
      of powers that must be vested in the two branches, and which w<sup>d</sup>
      destroy the equilibrium of interests.

      entirely federal in her disposition. He appealed to her great exertions
      during the war, in supplying both men &amp; money. The muster rolls would
      show she had more troops in the field than Virg<sup>a</sup>. If she had
      been Delinquent, it had been from inability, and not more so than other

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman. M<sup>r</sup> Madison had animadverted on the
      delinquency of the States, when his object required him to prove that the
      Constitution of Cong<sup>s</sup> was faulty. Cong<sup>s</sup> is not to
      blame for the faults of the States. Their measures have been right, and

      M<sup>r</sup> Davy was much embarrassed and wished for explanations. The
      Report of the Committee allowing the Legislatures to choose the Senate,
      and establishing a proportional representation in it, seemed to be
      impracticable. There will according to this rule be ninety members in the
      outset, and the number will increase as new States are added. It was
      impossible that so numerous a body could possess the activity and other
      qualities required in it. Were he to vote on the comparative merits of the
      report as it stood, and the amendment, he should be constrained to prefer
      the latter. The appointment of the Senate by electors chosen by the people
      for that purpose was he conceived liable to an insuperable difficulty. The
      larger Counties or districts thrown into a general district, would
      certainly prevail over the smaller Counties or Districts, and merit in the
      latter would be excluded altogether. The report therefore seemed to be
      right in referring the appointment to the Legislatures, whose agency in
      the general System did not appear to him objectionable as it did to some
      others. The fact was that the local prejudices &amp; interests which could
      not be denied to exist, would find their way into the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page280" id="page280"></a>[pg&nbsp;280]</span> national Councils
      whether the Representatives should be chosen by the Legislatures or by the
      people themselves. On the other hand if a proportional representation was
      attended with insuperable difficulties, the making the Senate the
      Representative of the States, looked like bringing us back to Cong<sup>s</sup>
      again, and shutting out all the advantages expected from it. Under this
      view of the subject he could not vote for any plan for the Senate yet
      proposed. He thought that in general there were extremes on both sides. We
      were partly federal, partly national in our Union, and he did not see why
      the Gov<sup>t</sup> might not in some respects operate on the States, in
      others on the people.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson admitted the question concerning the number of
      Senators, to be embarrassing. If the smallest States be allowed one, and
      the others in proportion, the Senate will certainly be too numerous. He
      looked forward to the time when the smallest States will contain 100,000
      souls at least. Let there be then one Senator in each for every 100,000
      souls and let the States not having that n<sup>o</sup> of inhabitants be
      allowed one. He was willing himself to submit to this temporary concession
      to the small States; and threw out the idea as a ground of compromise.

      Doc<sup>r</sup> Franklin. The diversity of opinions turns on two points.
      If a proportional representation takes place, the small States contend
      that their liberties will be in danger. If an equality of votes is to be
      put in its place, the large States say their money will be in danger. When
      a broad table is to be made, and the edges of planks do not fit, the
      artist takes a little from both, and makes a good joint. In like manner
      here both sides must part with some of their demands, in order that they
      may join in some accommodating proposition. He had prepared one which he
      would read, that it might lie on the table <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page281" id="page281"></a>[pg&nbsp;281]</span> for consideration.
      The proposition was in the words following
    </p>
    <blockquote>
      <p class="indent">
        "That the Legislatures of the several States shall choose &amp; send an
        equal number of Delegates, namely &mdash;&mdash; who are to compose the
        2<sup>d</sup> branch of the General Legislature&mdash;
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        That in all cases or questions wherein the Sovereignty of individual
        States may be affected, or whereby their authority over their own
        Citizens may be diminished, or the authority of the General Government
        within the several States augmented, each State shall have equal
        suffrage.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        That in the appointment of all Civil officers of y<sup>e</sup> Gen<sup>l</sup>
        Gov<sup>t</sup> in the election of whom the 2<sup>d</sup> branch may by
        the Constitution have part, each State shall have equal suffrage.
      </p>
      <p class="indent">
        That in fixing the Salaries of such Officers, and in all allowances for
        public services, and generally in all appropriations &amp; dispositions
        of money to be drawn out of the general Treasury; and in all laws for
        supplying that Treasury, the Delegates of the several States shall have
        suffrage in proportion to the Sums which their respective States do
        actually contribute to the Treasury." Where a ship had many owners this
        was the rule of deciding on her expedition. He had been one of the
        Ministers from this Country to France during the joint war and w<sup>d</sup>

        it on.

      M<sup>r</sup> King observed that the simple question was whether each
      State should have an equal vote in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch; that it must
      be apparent to those Gentlemen who liked neither the motion for this
      equality, nor the report as it stood, that the report was as susceptible
      of melioration as the motion; that a reform would be nugatory &amp;
      nominal only if we should make another Congress of the proposed Senate:
      that if the adherence to an equality of votes <span class="pagenum"><a

      unalterable, there could not be less obstinacy on the other side, &amp;
      that we were in fact cut asunder already, and it was in vain to shut our
      eyes against it: that he was however filled with astonishment that if we
      were convinced that every <i>man</i> in America was secured in all his
      rights, we should be ready to sacrifice this substantial good to the
      Phantom of <i>State</i> sovereignty: that his feelings were more harrowed
      &amp; his fears more agitated for his Country than he could express, that
      he conceived this to be the last opportunity of providing for its liberty
      &amp; happiness: that he could not therefore but repeat his amazement that
      when a just govern<sup>t</sup> founded on a fair representation of the <i>people</i>
      of America was within our reach, we should renounce the blessing, from an
      attachment to the ideal freedom &amp; importance of <i>States</i>: that
      should this wonderful illusion continue to prevail, his mind was prepared
      for every event, rather than to sit down under a Gov<sup>t</sup> founded
      in a vicious principle of representation, and which must be as short lived
      as it would be unjust. He might prevail on himself to accede to some such
      expedient as had been hinted by M<sup>r</sup> Wilson; but he never could
      listen to an equality of votes as proposed in the motion.

      experienced have proceeded from the equality now objected to; and that the
      seeds of dissolution for the State Governments are not sown in the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Government. He considered the system on the table as a novelty, an
      amphibious monster; and was persuaded that it never would be rec<sup>d</sup>

      M<sup>r</sup> Bedford, contended that there was no middle way between a
      perfect consolidation and a mere confederacy of the States. The first is
      out of the question, and in the latter they must continue if not
      perfectly, yet equally sovereign. If political Societies possess ambition
      avarice, and all the other passions which render them formidable to each
      other, ought we not to view them in this light here? Will not the same
      motives operate in America as elsewhere? If any gentleman doubts it let
      him look at the votes. Have they not been dictated by interest, by
      ambition? Are not the large States evidently seeking to aggrandize
      themselves at the expense of the small? They think no doubt that they have
      right on their side, but interest had blinded their eyes. Look at Georgia.
      Though a small State at present, she is actuated by the prospect of soon
      being a great one. S.&nbsp;Carolina is actuated both by present interest
      &amp; future prospects. She hopes too to see the other States cut down to
      her own dimensions. N.&nbsp;Carolina has the same motives of present &amp;
      future interest. Virg<sup>a</sup> follows. Mary<sup>d</sup> is not on that
      side of the Question. Pen<sup>a</sup> has a direct and future interest.
      Mass<sup>ts</sup> has a decided and palpable interest in the part she
      takes. Can it be expected that the small States will act from pure
      disinterestedness. Look at G. Britain. Is the Representation there less
      unequal? But we shall be told again that that is the rotten part of the
      Constitution. Have not the boroughs however held fast their constitutional
      rights? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page284" id="page284"></a>[pg&nbsp;284]</span>
      And are we to act with greater purity than the rest of mankind. An exact
      proportion in the Representation is not preserved in any one of the
      States. Will it be said that an inequality of power will not result from
      an inequality of votes. Give the opportunity, and ambition will not fail
      to abuse it. The whole History of mankind proves it. The three large
      States have a common interest to bind them together in commerce. But
      whether a combination as we suppose, or a competition as others suppose,
      shall take place among them, in either case, the small States must be
      ruined. We must like Solon make such a Govern<sup>t</sup> as the people
      will approve. Will the smaller States ever agree to the proposed
      degradation of them. It is not true that the people will not agree to
      enlarge the powers of the present Cong<sup>s</sup>. The language of the
      people has been that Cong<sup>s</sup> ought to have the power of
      collecting an impost, and of coercing the States where it may be
      necessary. On The first point they have been explicit &amp;, in a manner,
      unanimous in their declarations. And must they not agree to this &amp;
      similar measures if they ever mean to discharge their engagements. The
      little States are willing to observe their engagements, but will meet the
      large ones on no ground but that of the Confederation. We have been told
      with a dictatorial air that this is the last moment for a fair trial in
      favor of a Good Governm<sup>t</sup>. It will be the last indeed if the
      propositions reported from the Committee go forth to the people. He was
      under no apprehensions. The Large States dare not dissolve the
      Confederation. If they do the small ones will find some foreign ally of
      more honor and good faith, who will take them by the hand and do them
      justice. He did not mean by this to intimidate or alarm. It was a natural
      consequence, which ought to be avoided by enlarging the federal powers not
      annihilating the federal system. This is what the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page285" id="page285"></a>[pg&nbsp;285]</span> people expect. All
      agree in the necessity of a more efficient Gov<sup>t</sup> and why not

      but that was all. What he wanted was domestic happiness. The Nat<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> could not descend to the local objects on which this
      depended. It could only embrace objects of a general nature. He turned his
      eyes therefore for the preservation of his rights to the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>.
      From these alone he could derive the greatest happiness he expects in this
      life. His happiness depends on their existence, as much as a new born

      apprehended a dangerous encroachment on their jurisdictions. Expedients
      might be devised as he conceived that would give them all the security the
      nature of things would admit of. In the establish<sup>t</sup> of Societies
      the Constitution was to the Legislature what the laws were to individuals.
      As the fundamental rights of individuals are secured by express provisions
      in the State Constitutions; why may not a like security be provided for
      the Rights of States in the National Constitution. The articles of Union
      between Engl<sup>d</sup> &amp; Scotland furnish an example of such a
      provision in favor of sundry rights of Scotland. When that Union was in
      agitation, the same language of apprehension which has been heard from the
      smaller States, was in the mouths of the Scotch patriots. The articles
      however have not been violated and the Scotch have found an increase of
      prosperity &amp; happiness. He was aware that this will be <span

      against physical power, neither will there be any safety ag<sup>st</sup>
      it if there be no compact. He could not sit down, without taking some
      notice of the language of the honorable gentleman from Delaware (M<sup>r</sup>
      Bedford). It was not he that had uttered a dictatorial language. This
      intemperance had marked the honorable Gentleman himself. It was not he who
      with a vehemence unprecedented in that House, had declared himself ready
      to turn his hopes from our common Country, and court the protection of
      some foreign hand. This too was the language of the Honbl member himself.
      He was grieved that such a thought had entered into his heart. He was more
      grieved that such an expression had dropped from his lips. The gentleman c<sup>d</sup>
      only excuse it to himself on the score of passion. For himself whatever
      might be his distress, he w<sup>d</sup> never court relief from a foreign
      power.

      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney thought an equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch inadmissible. At the same time candor obliged him to admit that the
      large States would feel a partiality for their own Citizens &amp; give
      them a preference, in appointments: that they might also find some common
      points in their Commercial interests, and promote treaties favorable to
      them. There <span class="pagenum"><a name="page287" id="page287"></a>[pg&nbsp;287]</span>
      is a real distinction [between] the Northern &amp; South<sup>n</sup>
      interests. N.&nbsp;Carol<sup>a</sup> S.&nbsp;Carol: &amp; Geo. in their
      Rice &amp; Indigo had a peculiar interest which might be sacrificed. How
      then shall the larger States be prevented from administering the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> as they please, without being themselves unduly subjected
      to the will of the smaller? By allowing them some but not a full,
      proportion. He was extremely anxious that something should be done,
      considering this as the last appeal to a regular experiment. Cong<sup>s</sup>
      have failed in almost every effort for an amendment of the federal System.
      Nothing has prevented a dissolution of it, but the appointm<sup>t</sup> of
      this Convention; &amp; he could not express his alarms for the consequence
      of such an event. He read his motion, to form the States into classes,
      with an apportionment of Senators among them (see Art: 4, of his plan).
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      General Pinkney was willing the motion might be considered. He did not
      entirely approve it. He liked better the motion of Doc<sup>r</sup>
      Franklin (which see Saturday June 30). Some Compromise seemed to be
      necessary, the States being exactly divided on the question for an
      equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch. He proposed that a
      Committee consisting of a member from each State should be appointed to
      devise &amp; report some compromise.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> L. Martin had no objection to a commitment, but no
      modifications whatever could reconcile the Smaller States to the least
      diminution of their equal Sovereignty.

      name="page288" id="page288"></a>[pg&nbsp;288]</span> Convention had been
      equally divided. He had a stronger reason also. The mode of appointing the
      2<sup>d</sup> branch tended he was sure to defeat the object of it. What
      is this object? To check the precipitation, changeableness, and excesses
      of the first branch. Every man of observation had seen in the democratic
      branches of the State Legislatures, precipitation&mdash;in Congress
      changeableness, in every department excesses ag<sup>st</sup> personal
      liberty private property &amp; personal safety. What qualities are
      necessary to constitute a check in this case? <i>Abilities</i> and <i>virtue</i>,
      are equally necessary in both branches. Something more then is now wanted,
      1. the checking branch must have a personal interest in checking the other
      branch, one interest must be opposed to another interest. Vices as they
      exist, must be turned ag<sup>st</sup> each other. 2. It must have great
      personal property, it must have the aristocratic spirit; it must love to
      lord it thro&#39; pride. Pride is indeed the great principle that actuates
      both the poor &amp; the rich. It is this principle which in the former
      resists, in the latter abuses authority. 3. It should be independent. In
      Religion the Creature is apt to forget its Creator. That it is otherwise
      in Political Affairs, the late debates here are an unhappy proof. The
      aristocratic body, should be as independent &amp; as firm as the
      democratic. If the members of it are to revert to a dependence on the
      democratic choice, the democratic scale will preponderate. All the guards
      contrived by America have not restrained the Senatorial branches of the
      Legislatures from a servile complaisance to the democratic. If the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch is to be dependent we are better without it. To make it
      independent, it should be for life. It will then do wrong, it will be
      said. He believed so; He hoped so. The Rich will strive to establish their
      dominion &amp; enslave the rest. They always did. They always will. The
      proper security ag<sup>st</sup> them is <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page289" id="page289"></a>[pg&nbsp;289]</span> to form them into a
      separate interest. The two forces will then controul each other. Let the
      rich mix with the poor and in a Commercial Country, they will establish an
      Oligarchy. Take away commerce, and the democracy will triumph. Thus it has
      been all the world over. So it will be among us. Reason tells us we are
      but men: and we are not to expect any particular interference of Heaven in
      our favor. By thus combining &amp; setting apart, the aristocratic
      interest, the popular interest will be combined ag<sup>st</sup> it. There
      will be a mutual check and mutual security. 4. An independence for life,
      involves the necessary permanency. If we change our measures nobody will
      trust us: and how avoid a change of measures, but by avoiding a change of
      men. Ask any man if he confides in Cong<sup>s</sup> if he confides in the
      State of Pen<sup>a</sup> if he will lend his money or enter into contract?
      He will tell you no. He sees no stability. He can repose no confidence. If
      G. B. were to explain her refusal to treat with us, the same reasoning
      would be employed.&mdash;He disliked the exclusion of the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch from holding offices. It is dangerous. It is like the imprudent
      exclusion of the military officers during the war, from civil
      appointments. It deprives the Executive of the principal source of
      influence. If danger be apprehended from the Executive what a left-handed
      way is this of obviating it? If the son, the brother or the friend can be
      appointed, the danger may be even increased, as the disqualified father
      &amp;c. can then boast of a disinterestedness which he does not possess.
      Besides shall the best, the most able, the most virtuous citizens not be
      permitted to hold offices? Who then are to hold them? He was also ag<sup>st</sup>
      paying the Senators. They will pay themselves if they can. If they can not
      they will be rich and can do without it. Of such the 2<sup>d</sup> branch
      ought to consist; and none but such can compose it if they <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page290" id="page290"></a>[pg&nbsp;290]</span>
      are not to be paid&mdash;He contended that the Executive should appoint
      the Senate &amp; fill up vacancies. This gets rid of the difficulty in the
      present question. You may begin with any ratio you please; it will come to
      the same thing. The members being independ<sup>t</sup> &amp; for life, may
      be taken as well from one place as from another.&mdash;It should be
      considered too how the scheme could be carried through the States. He
      hoped there was strength of mind eno&#39; in this House to look truth in
      the face. He did not hesitate therefore to say that loaves &amp; fishes
      must bribe the Demagogues. They must be made to expect higher offices
      under the general than the State Gov<sup>ts</sup>. A Senate for life will
      be a noble bait. Without such captivating prospects, the popular leaders
      will oppose &amp; defeat the plan. He perceived that the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch was to be chosen by the people of the States; the 2<sup>d</sup> by
      those chosen by the people. Is not here a Gov<sup>t</sup> by the States, a
      Govern<sup>t</sup> by Compact between Virg<sup>a</sup> in the 1<sup>st</sup>
      &amp; 2<sup>d</sup> branch, Mass<sup>ts</sup> in the 1<sup>st</sup> &amp;
      2<sup>d</sup> branch &amp;c. This is going back to mere treaty. It it no
      Gov<sup>t</sup> at all. It is altogether dependent on the States, and will
      act over again the part which Cong<sup>s</sup> has acted. A firm Govern<sup>t</sup>
      alone can protect our liberties. He fears the influence of the rich. They
      will have the same effect here as elsewhere if we do not by such a Gov<sup>t</sup>
      keep them within their proper sphere. We should remember that the people
      never act from reason alone. The Rich will take the advantage of their
      passions &amp; make these the instruments for oppressing them. The Result
      of the Contest will be a violent aristocracy, or a more violent despotism.
      The schemes of the Rich will be favored by the extent of the Country. The
      people in such distant parts cannot communicate &amp; act in concert. They
      will be the dupes of those who have more knowledge &amp; intercourse. The
      only security ag<sup>st</sup> encroachments will be a select &amp;
      sagacious body of <span class="pagenum"><a name="page291" id="page291"></a>[pg&nbsp;291]</span>
      men, instituted to watch ag<sup>st</sup> them on all sides. He meant only
      to hint these observations, without grounding any motion on them.

      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph favored the commitment though he did not expect
      much benefit from the expedient. He animadverted on the warm &amp; rash
      language of M<sup>r</sup> Bedford on Saturday; reminded the small States
      that if the large States should combine some danger of which he did not
      deny there would be a check in the revisionary power of the Executive, and
      intimated that in order to render this still more effectual, he would
      agree that in the choice of an Executive each State should have an equal
      vote. He was persuaded that two such opposite bodies as M<sup>r</sup>
      Morris had planned, could never long co-exist. Dissentions would arise, as
      has been seen even between the Senate and H. of Delegates in Maryland,
      appeals would be made to the people; and in a little time commotions would
      be the result&mdash;He was far from thinking the large States could
      subsist of themselves any more than the small; an avulsion would involve
      the whole in ruin, and he was determined to pursue such a scheme of
      Government as would secure us ag<sup>st</sup> such a calamity.

      M<sup>r</sup> Strong was for the com&#771;itment; and hoped the mode of

            discharge the business with which they were intrusted. By the
            proceedings in the Convention, they were so equally divided on the
            important question of <i>representation in the two branches</i>,
            that the idea of a conciliatory adjustment must have been in
            contemplation of the house in the appointment of this committee. But
            still, how to effect this salutory purpose was the question. Many of
            the members, impressed with the utility of a general government,
            connected with it the indispensable necessity of a representation
            from the states according to their numbers and wealth; while others,
            equally tenacious of the rights of the states, would admit of no
            other representation but such as <i>was strictly federal</i>, or, in
            other words, <i>equality of suffrage</i>. This brought on a
            discussion of the principles on which the house had divided, and a
            lengthy recapitulation of the arguments advanced in the house in
            support of these opposite propositions. As I had not openly
            explained my sentiments on any former occasion on this question, but

        Resol. of the Report from the Committee of the Whole House, and so much

        Convention on condition that both shall be generally adopted. I. that in
        the 1<sup>st</sup> branch of the Legislature each of the States now in
        the Union shall be allowed 1 member for every 40,000 inhabitants of the
        description reported in the 7<sup>th</sup> Resolution of the Com<sup>e</sup>
        of the whole House: that each State not containing that number shall be
        allowed 1 member: that all bills for raising or appropriating money, and
        for fixing the salaries of the officers of the Govern<sup>t</sup> of the
        U. States shall originate in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch of the
        Legislature, and shall not be altered or amended by the 2<sup>d</sup>
        branch; and that no money shall be drawn from the public Treasury but in

          href="#FNanchor_125_125"> <span class="label">[125]</span></a> This
          report was founded on a motion in the Com&#771;itte made by D<sup>r</sup>
          Franklin. It was barely acquiesced in by the members from the States
          opposed to an equity of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch and was
          evidently considered by the members on the other side, as a gaining of
          their point. A motion was made by M<sup>r</sup> Sherman. He acted in
          the place of M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth who was kept away by
          indisposition, in the Committee to the following effect "that each
          State should have an equal vote in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch; provided
          that no decision therein should prevail unless the majority of States
          concurring should also comprise a majority of the inhabitants of the
          U. States." This motion was not much deliberated on nor approved in
          the Committee. A similar proviso had been proposed in the debates on
          the articles of Confederation in 1777, to the articles giving certain
          powers to "nine States." See Journals of Cong<sup>s</sup> for 1777, p.

      M<sup>r</sup> Ghoram observed that as the report consisted of propositions
      mutually conditional he wished to hear some explanations touching the
      grounds on which the conditions were estimated.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry. The Committee were of different opinions as well as
      the Deputations from which the Com<sup>e</sup> were taken, and agreed to
      the Report merely in order that some ground of accommodation might be
      proposed. Those opposed to the equality of <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page296" id="page296"></a>[pg&nbsp;296]</span> votes have only
      assented conditionally; and if the other side do not generally agree will
      not be under any obligation to support the Report.

      Mr. Wilson thought the Committee had exceeded their powers.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Martin was for taking the question on the whole report.

    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison could not regard the privilege of originating money
      bills as any concession on the side of the small States. Experience proved
      that it had no effect. If seven States in the upper branch wished a bill
      to be originated, they might surely find some member from some of the same
      States in the lower branch who would originate it. The restriction as to
      amendments was of as little consequence. Amendments could be handed
      privately by the Senate to members in the other house. Bills could be
      negatived that they might be sent up in the desired shape. If the Senate
      should yield to the obstinacy of the 1<sup>st</sup> branch the use of that
      body as a check would be lost. If the 1<sup>st</sup> branch should yield
      to that of the Senate, the privilege would be nugatory. Experience had
      also shewn both in G. B. and the States having a similar regulation that
      it was a source of frequent &amp; obstinate altercations. These
      considerations had produced a rejection of a like motion on a former
      occasion when judged by its own merits. It could not therefore be deemed
      any concession on the present, and left in force all the objections which
      had prevailed ag<sup>st</sup> allowing each State an equal voice. He
      conceived that the Convention was reduced to the alternative of either
      departing from justice in order to conciliate the smaller States, and the
      minority of the people of the U. S.&nbsp;or of displeasing these by justly
      gratifying the larger States and the majority of the people. He could not
      himself hesitate <span class="pagenum"><a name="page297" id="page297"></a>[pg&nbsp;297]</span>
      as to the option he ought to make. The Convention with justice &amp; the
      majority of the people on their side, had nothing to fear. With injustice
      and the minority on their side they had every thing to fear. It was in
      vain to purchase concord in the Convention on terms which would perpetuate
      discord among their Constituents. The Convention ought to pursue a plan
      which would bear the test of examination, which would be espoused &amp;
      supported by the enlightened and impartial part of America, &amp; which
      they could themselves vindicate and urge. It should be considered that
      altho&#39; at first many may judge of the system recom&#771;ended, by
      their opinion of the Convention, yet finally all will judge of the
      Convention by the System. The merits of the System alone can finally &amp;
      effectually obtain the public suffrage. He was not apprehensive that the
      people of the small States would obstinately refuse to accede to a Gov<sup>t</sup>
      founded on just principles, and promising them substantial protection. He
      could not suspect that Delaware would brave the consequences of seeking
      her fortunes apart from the other States, rather than submit to such a Gov<sup>t</sup>;
      much less could he suspect that she would pursue the rash policy of
      courting foreign support, which the warmth of one of her representatives
      (M<sup>r</sup> Bedford) had suggested, or if she sh<sup>d</sup>, that any
      foreign nation w<sup>d</sup> be so rash as to hearken to the overture. As
      little could he suspect that the people of N.&nbsp;Jersey notwithstanding
      the decided tone of the gentlemen from that State, would choose rather to
      stand on their own legs, and bid defiance to events, than to acquiesce
      under an establishment founded on principles the justice of which they
      could not dispute, and absolutely necessary to redeem them from the
      exactions levied on them by the com&#771;erce of the neighbouring States.
      A review of other States would prove that there was as little reason to
      apprehend an inflexible opposition <span class="pagenum"><a name="page298"
      id="page298"></a>[pg&nbsp;298]</span> elsewhere. Harmony in the Convention
      was no doubt much to be desired. Satisfaction to all the States, in the
      first instance still more so. But if the principal States comprehending a
      majority of the people of the U. S.&nbsp;should concur in a just &amp;
      judicious plan, he had the firmest hopes, that all the other States would
      by degrees accede to it.<a name="FNanchor_126_126" id="FNanchor_126_126"></a><a

      M<sup>r</sup> Butler said he could not let down his idea of the people, of
      America so far as to believe they would from mere respect to the
      Convention adopt a plan evidently unjust. He did not consider the
      privilege concerning money bills as of any consequence. He urged that the
      2<sup>d</sup> branch ought to represent the States according to their
      property.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris, thought the form as well as the
      matter of the Report objectionable. It seemed in the first place to render
      amendments impracticable. In the next place, it seemed to involve a pledge
      to agree to the 2<sup>d</sup> part if the 1<sup>st</sup> sh<sup>d</sup> be
      agreed to. He conceived the whole aspect of it to be wrong. He came here
      as a Representative of America; he flattered himself he came here in some
      degree as a Representative of the whole human race; for the whole human
      race will be affected by the proceedings of this Convention. He wished
      gentlemen to extend their views beyond the present moment of time; beyond
      the narrow limits of place from which they derive their political origin.
      If he were to believe some things which he had heard, he should suppose
      that we were assembled to truck and bargain for our particular States. He
      can not descend to think that any gentlemen are really actuated by these
      views. We must look forward to the effects of what we do. These alone
      ought to guide us. Much has been said <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page299" id="page299"></a>[pg&nbsp;299]</span> of the sentiments of
      the people. They were unknown. They could not be known. All that we can
      infer is that if the plan we recommend be reasonable &amp; right; all Who
      have reasonable minds and sound intentions will embrace it,
      notwithstanding what had been said by some gentlemen. Let us suppose that
      the larger States shall agree; and that the smaller refuse; and let us
      trace the consequences. The opponents of the system in the smaller States
      will no doubt make a party, and a noise for a time, but the ties of
      interest, of kindred &amp; of common habits which connect them with other
      States will be too strong to be easily broken. In N.&nbsp;Jersey
      particularly he was sure a great many would follow the sentiments of Pen<sup>a</sup>
      &amp; N.&nbsp;York. This Country must be united. If persuasion does not
      unite it, the sword will. He begged that this consideration might have its
      due weight. The scenes of horror attending Civil commotion cannot be
      described, and the conclusion of them will be worse than the term of their
      continuance. The stronger party will then make traytors of the weaker; and
      the Gallows &amp; Halter will finish the work of the sword. How far
      foreign powers would be ready to take part in the confusions he would not
      say. Threats that they will be invited have it seems been thrown out. He
      drew the melancholy picture of foreign intrusions as exhibited in the
      History of Germany, &amp; urged it as a standing lesson to other nations.
      He trusted that the Gentlemen who may have hazarded such expressions, did
      not entertain them till they reached their own lips. But returning to the
      Report he could not think it in any respect calculated for the Public
      good. As the 2<sup>d</sup> branch is now constituted, there will be
      constant disputes &amp; appeals to the States which will undermine the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Government &amp; controul &amp; annihilate the 1<sup>st</sup> branch.
      Suppose that the delegates from Mass<sup>ts</sup> &amp; Rho I. in the
      Upper House disagree, and <span class="pagenum"><a name="page300"
      id="page300"></a>[pg&nbsp;300]</span> that the former are outvoted. What
      Results? they will immediately declare that their State will not abide by
      the decision, and make such representations as will produce that effect.
      The same may happen as to Virg<sup>a</sup> &amp; other States. Of what
      avail then will be what is on paper. State attachments, and State
      importance have been the bane of this Country. We cannot annihilate; but
      we may perhaps take out the teeth of the serpents. He wished our ideas to
      be enlarged to the true interest of man, instead of being circumscribed
      within the narrow compass of a particular Spot. And after all how little
      can be the motive yielded by selfishness for such a policy. Who can say
      whether he himself, much less whether his children, will the next year be
      an inhabitant of this or that State.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Bedford. He found that what he had said as to the small
      States being taken by the hand, had been misunderstood; and he rose to
      explain. He did not mean that the small States would court the aid &amp;
      interposition of foreign powers. He meant that they would not consider the
      federal compact as dissolved untill it should be so by the Acts of the
      large States. In this case The consequences of the breach of faith on
      their part, and the readiness of the small States to fulfill their
      engagements, would be that foreign Nations having demands on this Country
      would find it their interest to take the small States by the hand, in
      order to do themselves justice. This was what he meant. But no man can
      foresee to what extremities the small States may be driven by oppression.
      He observed also in apology that some allowance ought to be made for the
      habits of his profession in which warmth was natural &amp; sometimes
      necessary. But is there not an apology in what was said by (M<sup>r</sup>
      Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris) that the sword is to unite: by M<sup>r</sup>
      Ghorum that Delaware must be annexed to Penn<sup>a</sup> and N.&nbsp;Jersey
      divided between <span class="pagenum"><a name="page301" id="page301"></a>[pg&nbsp;301]</span>
      Pen<sup>a</sup> and N.&nbsp;York. To hear such language without emotion,
      would be to renounce the feelings of a man and the duty of a Citizen&mdash;As
      to the propositions of the Committee, the lesser States have thought it
      necessary to have a security somewhere. This has been thought necessary
      for the Executive Magistrate of the proposed Gov<sup>t</sup> who has a
      sort of negative on the laws; and is it not of more importance that the
      States should be protected, than that the Executive branch of the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      sh<sup>d</sup> be protected. In order to obtain this, the smaller States
      have conceded as to the constitution of the first branch, and as to money
      bills. If they be not gratified by correspondent concessions as to the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch is it to be supposed they will ever accede to the plan; and what
      will be the consequence if nothing should be done? The condition of the U.
      States requires that something should be immediately done. It will be
      better that a defective plan should be adopted, than that none should be
      recommended. He saw no reason why defects might not be supplied with
      meetings 10, 15, or 20 years hence.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth said he had not attended the proceedings of the
      Committee, but was ready to accede to the compromise they had reported.
      Some compromise was necessary; and he saw none more convenient or
      reasonable.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson hoped that the expressions of individuals would
      not be taken for the sense of their colleagues, much less of their States
      which was not &amp; could not be known. He hoped also that the meaning of
      those expressions would not be misconstrued or exaggerated. He did not
      conceive that (M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris) meant that the sword
      ought to be drawn ag<sup>st</sup> the smaller States. He only pointed out
      the probable consequences of anarchy in the U. S. A similar exposition
      ought to be given of the expressions <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page302" id="page302"></a>[pg&nbsp;302]</span> of (M<sup>r</sup>
      Ghorum). He was ready to hear the Report discussed; but thought the
      propositions contained in it, the most objectionable of any he had yet
      heard.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson said that he had when the Report was agreed to in
      the Com<sup>e</sup> reserved to himself the right of freely discussing it.
      He acknowledged that the warmth complained of was improper; but he thought
      the Sword &amp; the Gallows little calculated to produce conviction. He
      complained of the manner in which M<sup>r</sup> M and M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      Morris had treated the small States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry. Tho&#39; he had assented to the Report in the
      Committee, he had very material objections to it. We were however in a
      peculiar situation. We were neither the same Nation nor different Nations.
      We ought not therefore to pursue the one or the other of these ideas too
      closely. If no compromise should take place what will be the consequence.
      A secession he foresaw would take place; for some gentlemen seem decided
      on it: two different plans will be proposed; and the result no man could
      foresee. If we do not come to some agreement among ourselves some foreign
      sword will probably do the work for us.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Mason. The Report was meant not as specific propositions to
      be adopted; but merely as a general ground of accommodation. There must be
      some accommodation on this point, or we shall make little further progress
      in the work. Accommodation was the object of the House in the appointment
      of the Committee; and of the Committee in the Report they had made. And
      however liable the Report might be to objections, he thought it preferable
      to an appeal to the world by the different sides, as had been talked of by
      some Gentlemen. It could not be more inconvenient to any gentleman to
      remain absent from his private affairs, than it was for him; but he would
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page303" id="page303"></a>[pg&nbsp;303]</span>
      bury his bones in this City rather than expose his Country to the
      Consequences of a dissolution of the Convention without any thing being
      done.

    <p class="indent">
      The 1<sup>st</sup> proposition in the report for fixing the representation
      in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch, "one member for every 40,000 inhabitants,"
      being taken up.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris objected to that scale of
      apportionment. He thought property ought to be taken into the estimate as
      well as the number of inhabitants. Life &amp; liberty were generally said
      to be of more value than property. An accurate view of the matter would
      nevertheless prove that property was the main object of Society. The
      Savage State was more favorable to liberty than the Civilized; and
      sufficiently so to life. It was preferred by all men who had not acquired
      a taste for property; it was only renounced for the sake of property which
      could only be secured by the restraints of regular Government. These ideas
      might appear to some new, but they were nevertheless just. If property
      then was the main object of Gov<sup>t</sup> certainly it ought to be one
      measure of the influence due to those who were to be affected by the
      Govern<sup>t</sup>. He looked forward also to that range of New States
      which w<sup>d</sup> soon be formed in the West. He thought the rule of
      representation ought to be so fixed as to secure to the Atlantic States a
      prevalence in the National Councils. The new States will know less of the
      public interest than these, will have an interest in many respects
      different, in particular will be little scrupulous of involving the
      Community in wars the burdens &amp; operations of which would fall chiefly
      on the maritime States. Provision ought therefore to be made to prevent
      the maritime States from being hereafter outvoted by them. He thought this
      might be easily done by irrevocably fixing the number of representatives
      which the Atlantic States should respectively have, and the number which
      each new State will have. <span class="pagenum"><a name="page304"
      id="page304"></a>[pg&nbsp;304]</span> This w<sup>d</sup> not be unjust, as
      the Western settlers w<sup>d</sup> previously know the conditions on which
      they were to possess their lands. It would be politic as it would recom&#771;end
      the plan to the present as well as future interest of the States which
      must decide the fate of it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge. The gentleman last up had spoken some of his
      sentiments precisely. Property was certainly the principal object of
      Society. If numbers should be made the rule of representation, the
      Atlantic States will be subjected to the Western. He moved that the first
      proposition in the report be postponed in order to take up the following
      viz "that the suffrages of the several States be regulated and
      proportioned according to the sums to be paid towards the general revenue
      by the inhabitants of each State respectively: that an apportionment of
      suffrages, according to the ratio aforesaid shall be made and regulated at
      the end of &mdash;&mdash; years from the 1<sup>st</sup> meeting of the
      Legislature of the U. S., and at the end of every &mdash;&mdash; years but
      that for the present, and until the period above mentioned, the suffrages
      shall be for N.&nbsp;Hampshire &mdash;&mdash; for Massach<sup>ts</sup>
      &mdash;&mdash; &amp;c.

    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason said the case of new States was not unnoticed in the Committee;
      but it was thought and he was himself decidedly of opinion that if they
      made a part of the Union, they ought to be subject to no unfavorable
      discriminations. Obvious considerations required it.

    <h2>
      <span class="smcap">Friday July 6<sup>th</sup> in Convention</span>
    </h2>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris moved to commit so much of the Report
      as relates to "1 member for every 40,000 <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page305" id="page305"></a>[pg&nbsp;305]</span> inhabitants." His
      view was that they might absolutely fix the number for each State in the
      first instance; leaving the Legislature at liberty to provide for changes
      in the relative importance of the States, and for the case of new States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson 2<sup>ded</sup> the motion; but with a view of
      leaving the Committee under no implied shackles.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum apprehended great inconveniency from fixing directly
      the number of Representatives to be allowed to each State. He thought the
      number of Inhabitants the true guide; tho&#39; perhaps some departure
      might be expedient from the full proportion. The States also would vary in
      their relative extent by separations of parts of the largest States. A
      part of Virg<sup>a</sup> is now on the point of a separation. In the
      province of Mayne a Convention is at this time deliberating on a
      separation from Mas<sup>ts</sup>. In such events the number of
      representatives ought certainly to be reduced. He hoped to see all the
      States made small by proper divisions, instead of their becoming
      formidable as was apprehended, to the Small States. He conceived that let
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Government be modified as it might, there would be a
      constant tendency in the State Governm<sup>ts</sup> to encroach upon it:
      it was of importance therefore that the extent of the States sh<sup>d</sup>
      be reduced as much &amp; as fast as possible. The stronger the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      shall be made in the first instance the more easily will these divisions
      be effected; as it will be of less consequence in the opinion of the
      States whether they be of great or small extent.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry did not think with his Colleague that the large States
      ought to be cut up. This policy has been inculcated by the middling and
      smaller States, ungenerously &amp; contrary to the spirit of the
      Confederation. Ambitious men will be apt to solicit needless divisions,
      till the States be reduced to the size of Counties. If this policy should
      still actuate the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page306" id="page306"></a>[pg&nbsp;306]</span>
      small States, the large ones cou&#39;d not confederate safely with them;
      but would be obliged to consult their safety by confederating only with
      one another. He favored the commitment and thought that Representation
      ought to be in the Combined ratio of numbers of Inhabitants and of wealth,
      and not of either singly.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> King wished the clause to be committed, chiefly in order to
      detach it from the Report with which it had no connection. He thought also
      that the Ratio of Representation proposed could not be safely fixed, since
      in a century &amp; a half our computed increase of population would carry
      the number of representatives to an enormous excess; that y<sup>e</sup>
      number of inhabitants was not the proper index of ability &amp; wealth;
      that property was the primary object of Society; and that in fixing a
      ratio this ought not to be excluded from the estimate.&mdash;With regard
      to new States, he observed that there was something peculiar in the
      business which had not been noticed. The U. S.&nbsp;were now admitted to
      be proprietors of the Country N.&nbsp;West of the Ohio. Cong<sup>s</sup>
      by one of their ordinances have impoliticly laid it out into ten States,
      and have made it a fundamental article of compact with those who may
      become settlers, that as soon as the number in any one state shall equal
      that of the smallest of the 13 original States, it may claim admission
      into the Union. Delaware does not contain it is computed more than 35,000
      souls, and for obvious reasons will not increase much for a considerable
      time. It is possible then that if this plan be persisted in by Cong<sup>s</sup>
      10 new votes may be added, without a greater addition of inhabitants than
      are represented by the single vote of Pen<sup>a</sup>. The plan as it
      respects one of the new States is already irrevocable, the sale of the
      lands having commenced, and the purchasers &amp; settlers will immediately
      become entitled to all the privileges of the compact.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page307" id="page307"></a>[pg&nbsp;307]</span>
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler agreed to the Commitment if the Committee were to be
      left at liberty. He was persuaded that the more the subject was examined,
      the less it would appear that the number of inhabitants would be a proper
      rule of proportion. If there were no other objection the changeableness of
      the standard would be sufficient. He concurred with those who thought some
      balance was necessary between the old &amp; the new States. He contended
      strenuously that property was the only just measure of representation.
      This was the great object of Govern<sup>t</sup>; the great cause of war;
      the great means of carrying it on.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney saw no good reason for committing. The value of land
      had been found on full investigation to be an impracticable rule. The
      contributions of revenue including imports &amp; exports must be too
      changeable in their amount; too difficult to be adjusted; and too
      injurious to the non-commercial States. The number of inhabitants appeared
      to him the only just &amp; practicable rule. He thought the blacks ought
      to stand on an equality with the whites: But w<sup>d</sup> agree to the
      ratio settled by Cong<sup>s</sup>. He contended that Cong<sup>s</sup> had
      no right under the articles of Confederation to authorize the admission of
      new States; no such case having been provided for.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Davy was for committing the clause in order to get at the
      merits of the question arising on the Report. He seemed to think that
      wealth or property ought to be represented in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch;
      and numbers in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch.

      taken, but should vote for the whole together.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason perceived the difficulty &amp; suggested a reference of the

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph disliked y<sup>e</sup> reference to that Committee,

      The 1<sup>st</sup> clause relating to the originating of money bills was
      then resumed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Govern<sup>r</sup> Morris was opposed to a restriction of
      this right in either branch, considered merely in itself and as
      unconnected with the point of representation in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch.
      It will disable the 2<sup>d</sup> branch from proposing its own money
      plans, and giving the people an opportunity of judging by comparison of
      the merits of those proposed by the 1<sup>st</sup> branch.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson could see nothing like a concession here on the part
      of the smaller States. If both branches were to say yes or no, it was of
      little consequence which should say yes or no first, which last. If either
      was indiscriminately to have the right of originating, the reverse of the
      Report, would he thought be most proper; since it was a maxim that the
      least numerous body was the fittest for deliberation; the most numerous
      for decision. He observed that this discrimination had been transcribed
      from the British into several American constitutions. But he was persuaded
      that on examination of the American experiments it would be found to be a
      trifle light as air. Nor could he ever discover the advantage of it in the
      Parliamentary history of G. Britain. He hoped if there was any advantage
      in the privilege, that it would be pointed out.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson thought that if the privilege were not common to
      both branches it ought rather to be confined to the 2<sup>d</sup> as the
      bills in that case would be more narrowly watched, than if they originated
      with the branch having most of the popular confidence.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Mason. The consideration which weighed with the Committee
      was that the 1<sup>st</sup> branch would be the immediate representatives
      of the people, the 2<sup>d</sup> would not. Should the latter have the
      power of giving away the people&#39;s money, they might soon forget the
      source from whence they received it. We <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page310" id="page310"></a>[pg&nbsp;310]</span> might soon have an
      aristocracy. He had been much concerned at the principles which had been
      advanced by some gentlemen, but had the satisfaction to find they did not
      generally prevail. He was a friend to proportional representation in both
      branches; but supposed that some points must be yielded for the sake of
      accomodation.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. If he had proposed that the 2<sup>d</sup> branch
      should have an independent disposal of public money, the observations of
      (Col. Mason) would have been a satisfactory answer. But nothing could be
      farther from what he had said. His question was how is the power of the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch increased or that of the 2<sup>d</sup> diminished by giving the
      proposed privilege to the former? Where is the difference, in which branch
      it begins, if both must concur, in the end?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry would not say that the concession was a sufficient one
      on the part of the small States. But he could not but regard it in the
      light of a concession. It w<sup>d</sup> make it a constitutional principle
      that the 2<sup>d</sup> branch were not possessed of the Confidence of the
      people in money matters, which w<sup>d</sup> lessen their weight &amp;
      influence. In the next place if the 2<sup>d</sup> branch were dispossessed
      of the privilege, they w<sup>d</sup> be deprived of the opportunity which
      their continuance in office 3 times as long as the 1<sup>st</sup> branch
      would give them of making three successive essays in favor of a particular
      point.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney thought it evident that the Concession was wholly on
      one side, that of the large States, the privilege of originating money
      bills being of no account.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris had waited to hear the good effects
      of the restriction. As to the alarm sounded, of an aristocracy, his creed
      was that there never was, nor ever will be a civilized Society without an
      aristocracy. His endeavor was to keep it as much as possible from doing
      mischief. The restriction if it has <span class="pagenum"><a name="page311"
      id="page311"></a>[pg&nbsp;311]</span> any real operation, will deprive us
      of the services of the 2<sup>d</sup> branch in digesting &amp; proposing
      money bills of which it will be more capable than the 1<sup>st</sup>
      branch. It will take away the responsibility of the 2<sup>d</sup> branch,
      the great security for good behavior. It will always leave a plea, as to
      an obnoxious money bill that it was disliked, but could not be
      constitutionally amended; nor safely rejected. It will be a dangerous
      source of disputes between the two Houses. We should either take the
      British Constitution altogether or make one for ourselves. The Executive
      there has dissolved two Houses as the only cure for such disputes. Will
      our Executive be able to apply such a remedy? Every law directly or
      indirectly takes money out of the pockets of the people. Again What use
      may be made of such a privilege in case of great emergency? Suppose an
      Enemy at the door, and money instantly &amp; absolutely necessary for
      repelling him, may not the popular branch avail itself of this duress, to
      extort concessions from the Senate destructive of the Constitution itself.
      He illustrated this danger by the example of the Long Parliament&#39;s
      exped<sup>ts</sup> for subverting the H. of Lords; concluding on the whole
      that the restriction would be either useless or pernicious.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Doc<sup>r</sup> Franklin did not mean to go into a justification of the
      Report, but as it had been asked what would be the use of restraining the
      2<sup>d</sup> branch from medling with money bills, he could not but
      remark that it was always of importance that the people should know who
      had disposed of their money, &amp; how it had been disposed of. It was a
      maxim that those who feel, can best judge. This end would, he thought, be
      best attained, if money affairs were to be confined to the immediate
      representatives of the people. This was his inducement to concur in the
      report. As to the danger or difficulty that might arise from a Negative in
      the 2<sup>d</sup> where the people <span class="pagenum"><a name="page312"
      id="page312"></a>[pg&nbsp;312]</span> w<sup>d</sup> not be proportionately
      represented, it might easily be got over by declaring that there should be
      no such negative; or if that will not do, by declaring that there shall be
      no such branch at all.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Martin said that it was understood in the Committee that the
      difficulties and disputes which had been apprehended, should be guarded ag<sup>st</sup>
      in the detailing of the plan.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. The difficulties &amp; disputes will increase with
      the attempts to define &amp; obviate them. Queen Anne was obliged to
      dissolve her Parliam<sup>t</sup> in order to terminate one of these
      obstinate disputes between the two Houses. Had it not been for the
      mediation of the Crown, no one can say what the result would have been.
      The point is still sub judice in England. He approved of the principles
      laid down by the Honble President (Doct<sup>r</sup> Franklin) his
      Colleague, as to the expediency of keeping the people informed of their
      money affairs. But thought they would know as much, and be as well
      satisfied, in one way as in the other.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney was astonished that this point should have been
      considered as a concession. He remarked that the restriction to money
      bills had been rejected on the merits singly considered, by 8 States ag<sup>st</sup>
      3. and that the very States which now called it a concession, were then ag<sup>st</sup>
      it as nugatory or improper in itself.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry. This is the critical question. He had rather agree to
      it than have no accommodation. A Govern<sup>t</sup> short of a proper
      national plan, if generally acceptable, would be preferable to a proper
      one which if it could be carried at all, would operate on discontented
      States. He thought it would be best to suspend the question till the Comm<sup>e</sup>

    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman Supposed that it was the wish of every one that some
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> should be established. An equal vote in
      the 2<sup>d</sup> branch would, he thought, be most likely to give it the
      necessary vigor. The small States have more vigor in their Gov<sup>ts</sup>
      than the large ones, the more influence therefore the large ones have, the
      weaker will be the Gov<sup>t</sup>. In the large States it will be most
      difficult to collect the real &amp; fair sense of the people. Fallacy
      &amp; undue influence will be practised with most success; and improper
      men will most easily get into office. If they vote by States in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch, and each State has an equal vote, there must be always a majority
      of States as well as a majority of the people on the side of public
      measures, &amp; the Gov<sup>t</sup> will have decision and efficacy. If
      this be not the case in <span class="pagenum"><a name="page314"

      be a majority of States ag<sup>st</sup> public measures, and the
      difficulty of compelling them to abide by the public determination, will
      render the Government feebler than it has ever yet been.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson was not deficient in a conciliating temper, but
      firmness was sometimes a duty of higher obligation. Conciliation was also

          gives the three speeches of Gerry, Madison and Pattersonas follows:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
          <p class="indent">
            "<i>Gerry.</i> I agree to the measure, provided that the first Br.
            (H. of Reps.) shall originate money bills and money appropriations.
            The prejudices as well as the interest of our Constituents must be
            regarded&mdash;two or three thousand men are in office in the States&mdash;their
            influence will be in favor of an Equality of votes among the States.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "<i>Madison.</i> Equality in the Senate will enable a minority to
            hold a majority, and to oblige them to submit to their interests, or
            they will withdraw their assent to measures essential and necessary
            to the general Good. I have known one man, when the State was
            represented by only two, and they were divided, oppose six States in
            Congress on an important occasion for three days, and finally compel
            them to gratify his caprice in order to obtain his suffrage. The
            Senate will possess certain exclusive Powers, such as the
            appointments to office, if the States have equal votes; a minority
            of People will appoint the Great Offices. Besides the small States
            may be near the Seat of Govt.&mdash;a bare Quorum of the H. of R.
            may be easily assembled, and carry a bill against the sense of a
            majority if all were present, and the Senate, tho&#39; all were
            present, might confirm such Bill. Virginia has objected to every
            addition of the powers of Congress, because she has only 1/13 of the
            Power when she ought to have one sixth.
          </p>
          <p class="indent">
            "<i>Paterson.</i> I hope the question will be taken: if we do not
            give equal votes in the Senate to the States, the small States
            agreeing that money Bills and appropriations shall originate in the
            H. of Reps., elected according to numbers, it must not be expected
            that the small States will agree to the amendments of the
            Confederation. Let us decide this question and lose no more time. I
            think that I shall vote against the provision, because I think that
            the exclusive originating of money Bills &amp; appropriations by the
            H. of Reps. is giving up too much on the part of the small States."&mdash;King&#39;s

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, observed that it w<sup>d</sup> be impossible to say
      what powers could be safely &amp; properly vested in the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      before it was known, in what manner the States were to be represented in
      it. He was apprehensive that if a just representation were not the basis
      of the Gov<sup>t</sup> it would happen, as it did when the Articles of
      Confederation were depending, that every effectual prerogative would be
      withdrawn or withheld, and the New Gov<sup>t</sup> w<sup>d</sup> be
      rendered as impotent and as shortlived as the old.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson would not decide whether the privilege concerning
      money bills were a valuable consideration or not: But he considered the
      mode &amp; rule of representation in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch as fully
      so; and that after the establishment of that point, the small States would
      never be able to defend themselves without an equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch. There was no other ground of accommodation. His resolution was
      fixt. He would meet the large States on that ground and no other. For
      himself he should vote ag<sup>st</sup> the Report, because it yielded too
      much.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page316" id="page316"></a>[pg&nbsp;316]</span>
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris. He had no resolution unalterably
      fixed except to do what should finally appear to him right. He was ag<sup>st</sup>
      the Report because it maintained the improper constitution of the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch. It made it another Congress, a mere whisp of straw. It had been s<sup>d</sup>
      (by M<sup>r</sup> Gerry) that the new Govern<sup>t</sup> would be partly
      national, partly federal; that it ought in the first quality to protect
      individuals; in the second, the States. But in what quality was it to
      protect the aggregate interest of the whole. Among the many provisions
      which had been urged, he had seen none for supporting the dignity and
      splendor of the American Empire. It had been one of our greatest
      misfortunes that the great objects of the nation had been sacrificed
      constantly to local views; in like manner as the general interests of
      States had been sacrificed to those of the Counties. What is to be the
      check in the Senate? none; unless it be to keep the majority of the people
      from injuring particular States. But particular States ought to be injured
      for the sake of a majority of the people, in case their conduct should
      deserve it. Suppose they should insist on claims evidently unjust, and
      pursue them in a manner detrimental to the whole body. Suppose they should
      give themselves up to foreign influence. Ought they to be protected in
      such cases. They were originally nothing more than colonial corporations.
      On the declaration of Independence, a Governm<sup>t</sup> was to be
      formed. The small States aware of the necessity of preventing anarchy, and
      taking advantage of the moment, extorted from the large ones an equality
      of votes. Standing now on that ground, they demand under the new system
      greater rights as men, than their fellow Citizens of the large States. The
      proper answer to them is that the same necessity of which they formerly
      took advantage, does not now exist, and that the large States are at
      liberty now to consider <span class="pagenum"><a name="page317"
      id="page317"></a>[pg&nbsp;317]</span> what is right, rather than what may
      be expedient. We must have an efficient Gov<sup>t</sup> and if there be an
      efficiency in the local Gov<sup>ts</sup> the former is impossible. Germany
      alone proves it. Notwithstanding their common diet, notwithstanding the
      great prerogatives of the Emperor as head of the Empire, and his vast
      resources, as sovereign of his particular dominions, no union is
      maintained; foreign influence disturbs every internal operation, &amp;
      there is no energy whatever in the General Governm<sup>t</sup>. Whence
      does this proceed? From the energy of the local authorities; from its
      being considered of more consequence to support the Prince of Hesse, than
      the Happiness of the people of Germany. Do Gentlemen wish this to be y<sup>e</sup>
      case here. Good God, Sir, is it possible they can so delude themselves.
      What if all the Charters &amp; Constitutions of the States were thrown
      into the fire, and all their demagogues into the Ocean. What would it be
      to the happiness of America. And will not this be the case here if we
      pursue the train in w<sup>ch</sup> the business lies. We shall establish
      an Aulic Council without an Emperor to execute its decrees. The same
      circumstances which unite the people here, unite them in Germany. They
      have there a common language, a common law, common usages and manners, and
      a common interest in being united; Yet their local jurisdictions destroy
      every tie. The case was the same in the Grecian States. The United
      Netherlands are at this time torn in factions. With these examples before
      our eyes shall we form establishments which must necessarily produce the
      same effects. It is of no consequence from what districts the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch shall be drawn, if it be so constituted as to yield an asylum ag<sup>st</sup>
      these evils. As it is now constituted he must be ag<sup>st</sup> its being
      drawn from the States in equal portions. But still he was ready to join in
      devising such an amendment of the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page318"
      id="page318"></a>[pg&nbsp;318]</span> plan, as will be most likely to
      secure our liberty &amp; happiness.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris delivered a report from the Com<sup>e</sup>

      Legislature be authorized from time to time to augment y<sup>e</sup>
      number of Representatives. And in case any of the States shall hereafter

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gorham. Some provision of this sort was necessary in the
      outset. The number of blacks &amp; whites with some regard to supposed
      wealth was the general guide. Fractions could not be observed. The Legisl<sup>re</sup>
      is to make alterations from time to time as justice &amp; propriety may
      require. Two objections prevailed ag<sup>st</sup> the rate of 1 member for
      every 40,000 inh<sup>ts</sup>. The 1<sup>st</sup> was that the
      Representation would soon be too numerous: the 2<sup>d</sup> that the West<sup>n</sup>
      States who may have a different interest, might if admitted on that
      principle by degrees, outvote the Atlantic. Both these objections are
      removed. The number will be small in the first instance and may be
      continued so. And the Atlantic States having y<sup>e</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>
      in their own hands, may take care of their own interest, by dealing out
      the right of Representation in safe proportions to the Western States.
      These were the views of the Committee.

      M<sup>r</sup> L. Martin wished to know whether the Com<sup>e</sup> were

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris. The Report is little more than a
      guess. Wealth was not altogether disregarded by the Com<sup>e</sup>. Where
      it was apparently in favor of one State, whose n<sup>os</sup> were
      superior to the numbers of another, by a fraction only, a member
      extraordinary was allowed to the former: and so vice versa. The Committee

      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson considered the proposed estimate for the future
      according to the combined rules of numbers and wealth, as too vague. For
      this reason N.&nbsp;Jersey was ag<sup>st</sup> it. He could regard negroes
      slaves in no light but as property. They are no free agents, have no
      personal liberty, no faculty of acquiring property, but on the contrary
      are themselves property, &amp; like other property entirely at the will of
      the Master. Has a man in Virg<sup>a</sup> a number of votes in proportion
      to the number of his slaves? And if negroes are not represented in the
      States to which they belong, why should they be represented in the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup>. What is the true principle of Representation? It is an
      expedient by which an assembly of certain individ<sup>ls</sup> chosen by
      the people is substituted in place of the inconvenient meeting of the
      people themselves. If such a meeting of the people was actually to take
      place, would the slaves vote? They would not. Why then sh<sup>d</sup> they
      be represented. He was also ag<sup>st</sup> such an indirect encouragem<sup>t</sup>
      of the slave trade; observing that Cong<sup>s</sup> in their act relating
      to the change of the 8 art: of Confed<sup>n</sup> had been ashamed to use
      the term "slaves" &amp; had substituted a description.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison reminded M<sup>r</sup> Patterson that his doctrine
      of Representation which was in its principle the genuine one, must forever
      silence the pretensions of the small States to an equality of votes with
      the large ones. They ought to vote in the same proportion in which their
      Citizens would do, if the people of all the States were collectively met.
      He suggested as a proper ground of compromise, that in the first branch
      the States should be represented according to their number of free
      inhabitants; And in the 2<sup>d</sup> which had for one of its primary
      objects the guardianship of property, according to the whole number,
      including slaves.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler urged warmly the justice &amp; necessity <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page322" id="page322"></a>[pg&nbsp;322]</span> of
      regarding wealth in the apportionment of Representation.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> King had always expected that as the Southern States are the
      richest, they would not league themselves with the North<sup>n</sup>
      unless some respect were paid to their superior wealth. If the latter
      expect those preferential distinctions in Commerce, &amp; other advantages
      which they will derive from the connexion they must not expect to receive
      them without allowing some advantages in return. Eleven out of 13 of the
      States had agreed to consider Slaves in the apportionment of taxation; and
      taxation and Representation ought to go together.

      M<sup>r</sup> King. N.&nbsp;Hampshire has probably more than 120,000 Inhab<sup>ts</sup>
      and has an extensive Country of tolerable fertility. Its inhab<sup>ts</sup>
      therefore may be expected to increase fast. He remarked that the four
      Eastern States, having 800,000 souls, have 1/3 fewer representatives than
      the four Southern States, having not more than 700,000 souls, rating the
      blacks as 5 for 3. The Eastern people will advert to these circumstances,
      and be dissatisfied. He believed them to be very desirous of uniting with
      their Southern brethren, but did not think it prudent to rely so far on
      that disposition as to subject them to any gross inequality. He was fully
      convinced that the question concerning a difference of interests did not
      lie where it had hitherto been discussed, between the great &amp; small
      States; but between the Southern &amp; Eastern. For this reason he had
      been ready to yield something in the proportion of representatives for the
      security of the Southern. No principle would justify the giving them a
      majority. They were brought as near an equality as was possible. He was
      not averse to giving them a still greater security, but did not see how it
      could be done.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney. The Report before it was committed was more
      favorable to the S.&nbsp;States than as it now stands. If they are to form
      so considerable a minority, and the regulation of trade is to be given to
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Government, they will be nothing more than overseers
      for the Northern States. He did not expect the S.&nbsp;States to be raised
      to a majority of representatives, but wished them to have something like
      an equality. At present by the alterations of the Com<sup>e</sup> in favor

      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson was not for reducing N.&nbsp;Hampshire from 3 to
      2, but for reducing some others. The South<sup>n</sup> Interest must be
      extremely endangered by the present arrangement. The North<sup>n</sup>

      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris regretted the turn of the debate. The

      Property ought to have its weight, but not all the weight. If the South<sup>n</sup>
      States are to supply money. The North<sup>n</sup> States are to spill
      their blood. Besides, the probable Revenue to be expected from the S.&nbsp;States

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, moved that the number allowed to each State be
      doubled. A <i>majority</i> of a <i>Quorum</i> of <i>65</i> members, was
      too small a number to represent the whole inhabitants of the U. States;
      They would not possess enough of the confidence of the people, and w<sup>d</sup>
      be too sparsely taken from the people, to bring with them all the local
      information which would be frequently wanted. Double the number will not
      be too great, even with the future additions from New States. The
      additional expence was too inconsiderable to be regarded in so important a
      case. And as far as the augmentation might be unpopular on that score, the
      objection was overbalanced by its effect on the hopes of a greater number
      of the popular candidates.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth urged the objection of expence, &amp; that the
      greater the number, the more slowly would the business proceed; and the
      less probably be decided as it ought, at last. He thought the number of
      Representatives too great in most of the State <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page326" id="page326"></a>[pg&nbsp;326]</span> Legislatures; and
      that a large number was less necessary in the Gen<sup>l</sup> Legislature
      than in those of the States, as its business would relate to a few great
      national Objects only.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman would have preferred 50 to 65. The great distance
      they will have to travel will render their attendance precarious and will
      make it difficult to prevail on a sufficient number of fit men to
      undertake the service. He observed that the expected increase from new
      States also deserved consideration.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry was for increasing the number beyond 65. The larger
      the number, the less the danger of their being corrupted. The people are
      accustomed to &amp; fond of a numerous representation, and will consider
      their rights as better secured by it. The danger of excess in the number
      may be guarded ag<sup>st</sup> by fixing a point within which the number
      shall always be kept.

    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason admitted that the objection drawn from the consideration of
      expence, had weight both in itself, and as the people might be affected by
      it. But he thought it outweighed by the objections ag<sup>st</sup> the
      smallness of the number. 38, will he supposes, as being a majority of 65.
      form a quorum. 20 will be a majority of 38. This was certainly too small a
      number to make laws for America. They would neither bring with them all
      the necessary information relative to various local interests, nor possess
      the necessary confidence of the people. After doubling the number, the
      laws might still be made by so few as almost to be objectionable on that
      account.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Read was in favor of the Motion. Two of the States (Del.
      &amp; R. I.) would have but a single member if the aggregate number should
      remain at 65. and in case of accident to either of these one State w<sup>d</sup>
      have no representative present to give explanations or <span

      informations of its interests or wishes. The people would not place their
      confidence in so small a number. He hoped the objects of the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> would be much more numerous than seemed to be expected by
      some gentlemen, and that they would become more &amp; more so. As to New

      limited, and all danger of excess thereby prevented.

      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge opposed the motion. The Representatives were too
      numerous in all the States. The full number allotted to the States may be

      therefore be considered. The interests of their Constituents will urge
      their attendance too strongly for it to be omitted: and he supposed the

      was to be fixed for taking a Census, it might certainly be extremely
      inconvenient: if unfixt the Legislature may use such a mode as will defeat
      the object: and perpetuate the inequality. He was always ag<sup>st</sup>
      such shackles on the Legisl<sup>re</sup>. They had been found very
      pernicious in most of the State Constitutions. He dwelt much on the danger
      of throwing such a preponderancy into the Western Scale, suggesting that
      in time the Western people w<sup>d</sup> outnumber the Atlantic States. He
      wished therefore to put it in the power of the latter to keep a majority
      of votes in their own hands. It was objected he said that if the Legisl<sup>re</sup>

      M<sup>r</sup> Mason. The greater the difficulty we find in fixing a proper
      rule of Representation, the more unwilling ought we to be, to throw the
      task from ourselves on the Gen<sup>l</sup> Legisl<sup>re</sup>. He did not
      object to the conjectural ratio which was to prevail in the outset; but
      considered a Revision from time to time according to some permanent &amp;
      precise standard as essential to y<sup>e</sup> fair representation
      required in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch. According to the present population
      of America, the North<sup>n</sup> part of it had a right to preponderate,
      and he could not deny it. But he wished it not to preponderate hereafter
      when the reason no longer continued. From the nature of man we may be sure
      that those who have power in their hands will not give it up while they
      can retain it. On the contrary we know that they will always when they can
      rather increase it. If the S.&nbsp;States therefore should have 3/4 of the
      people of America within their limits, the Northern will hold fast the
      majority of Representatives. 1/4 will govern the 3/4. The S. States will
      complain; but they may complain from generation to generation without
      redress. Unless some principle therefore which will do justice to them
      hereafter shall be inserted in the Constitution, disagreable as the
      declaration was to him, he must declare he could neither vote for the
      system here, nor support it, in his State. Strong objections had been
      drawn from the danger to the Atlantic interests from new Western States.
      Ought we to sacrifice what we know to be right in itself, lest it should
      prove favorable to States which are not yet in existence. If the Western
      States are to be admitted into the Union, as they arise, they must, he w<sup>d</sup>
      repeat, be treated as equals, and subjected to no degrading
      discriminations. They will <span class="pagenum"><a name="page330"
      id="page330"></a>[pg&nbsp;330]</span> have the same pride &amp; other
      passions which we have and will either not unite with or will speedily
      revolt from the Union, if they are not in all respects placed on an equal
      footing with their brethren. It has been said they will be poor, and
      unable to make equal contributions to the general Treasury. He did not
      know but that in time they would be both more numerous &amp; more wealthy
      than their Atlantic brethren. The extent &amp; fertility of their soil,
      made this probable; and though Spain might for a time deprive them of the
      natural outlet for their productions, yet she will, because she must,
      finally yield to their demands. He urged that numbers of inhabitants;
      though not always a precise standard of wealth was sufficiently so for
      every substantial purpose.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson was for making it a duty of the Legislature to do
      what was right &amp; not leaving it at liberty to do or not to do it. He
      moved that M<sup>r</sup> Randolph&#39;s propositions be postpon<sup>d</sup>
      in order to consider the following "that in order to ascertain the
      alterations that may happen in the population &amp; wealth of the several
      States, a census shall be taken of the free white inhabitants and 3/5<sup>ths</sup>
      of those of other descriptions on the 1<sup>st</sup> year after this
      Government shall have been adopted and every &mdash;&mdash; year
      thereafter; and that the Representation be regulated accordingly."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph agreed that M<sup>r</sup> Williamson&#39;s
      proposition should stand in the place of his. He observed that the ratio
      fixt for the 1<sup>st</sup> meeting was a mere conjecture, that it placed
      the power in the hands of that part of America, which could not always be
      entitled to it, that this power would not be voluntarily renounced; and
      that it was consequently the duty of the Convention to secure its
      renunciation when justice might so require; by some constitutional
      provisions. If equality between great &amp; small States be inadmissible,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page331" id="page331"></a>[pg&nbsp;331]</span>
      because in that case unequal numbers of Constituents w<sup>d</sup> be
      represented by equal number of votes; was it not equally inadmissible that
      a larger &amp; more populous district of America should hereafter have
      less representation, than a smaller &amp; less populous district. If a
      fair representation of the people be not secured, the injustice of the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      will shake it to its foundations. What relates to suffrage is justly
      stated by the celebrated Montesquieu, as a fundamental article in
      Republican Gov<sup>t</sup>. If the danger suggested by M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup>
      Morris be real, of advantage being taken of the Legislature in pressing
      moments, it was an additional reason, for tying their hands in such a
      manner that they could not sacrifice their trust to momentary
      considerations. Cong<sup>s</sup> have pledged the public faith to New
      States, that they shall be admitted on equal terms. They never would or
      ought to accede on any other. The census must be taken under the direction
      of the General Legislature. The States will be too much interested to take
      an impartial one for themselves.

      M<sup>r</sup> Butler &amp; Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney insisted that blacks be

      for that purpose moved that the words "three-fifths" be struck out.

    <p class="indent">

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum. This ratio was fixed by Cong<sup>s</sup> as a rule

      having slaves that the blacks were still more inferior to freemen. At
      present when the ratio of representation is to be established, we are
      assured that they are equal to freemen. The arguments on y<sup>e</sup>
      former occasion convinced him that 3/5 was pretty near the just proportion
      and he should vote according to the same opinion now.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler insisted that the labour of a slave in <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page332" id="page332"></a>[pg&nbsp;332]</span> S.&nbsp;Carol<sup>a</sup>
      was as productive &amp; valuable as that of a freeman in Mass<sup>ts</sup>,
      that as wealth was the great means of defence and utility to the Nation
      they were equally valuable to it with freemen; and that consequently an
      equal representation ought to be allowed for them in a Government which
      was instituted principally for the protection of property, and was itself
      to be supported by property.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Mason could not agree to the motion, notwithstanding it was
      favorable to Virg<sup>a</sup> because he thought it unjust. It was certain
      that the slaves were valuable, as they raised the value of land, increased
      the exports &amp; imports, and of course the revenue, would supply the
      means of feeding &amp; supporting an army, and might in cases of emergency
      become themselves soldiers. As in these important respects they were
      useful to the Community at large, they ought not to be excluded from the
      estimate of Representation. He could not however regard them as equal to
      freemen and could not vote for them as such. He added as worthy of remark,
      that the Southern States have this peculiar species of property over &amp;
      above the other species of property common to all the States.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson reminded M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum that if the South<sup>n</sup>
      States contended for the inferiority of blacks to whites when taxation was
      in view, the Eastern States on the same occasion contended for their
      equality. He did not however either then or now concur in either extreme,
      but approved of the ratio of 3/5.

      the proposition of M<sup>r</sup> Williamson. 1. It fettered the

      authorizing the Legislature to adjust the Representation from time to time
      on the principles of population &amp; wealth or with the principles of

      the s<sup>d</sup> Resolution would not be pursued. If as wealth, then why

      inhabitants was not a proper standard of wealth. The amazing difference
      between the comparative numbers &amp; wealth of different countries,
      rendered all reasoning superfluous on the subject. Numbers might with
      greater propriety be deemed a measure of strength, than of wealth, yet the
      late defence made by G. Britain, ag<sup>st</sup> her numerous enemies
      proved in the clearest manner, that it is entirely fallacious even in this
      respect.

      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge contended for the admission of wealth in the
      estimate by which Representation should be regulated. The Western States
      will not be able to contribute in proportion to their numbers; they sh<sup>d</sup>
      not therefore be represented in that proportion. The Atlantic States will
      not concur in such a plan. He moved that "at the end of &mdash;&mdash;
      years after the 1<sup>st</sup> meeting of the Legislature, and of every
      &mdash;&mdash; years thereafter, the Legislature shall proportion the
      Representation according to the principles of wealth &amp; population."

      the best rule for measuring wealth as well as representation; and that if
      the Legislature were to be governed by wealth, they would be obliged to
      estimate it by numbers. He was at first for leaving the matter wholly to
      the discretion of the Legislature; but he had been convinced by the
      observation of (M<sup>r</sup> Randolph &amp; M<sup>r</sup> Mason), that
      the <i>periods</i> &amp; the <i>rule</i>, of revising the Representation
      ought to be fixt by the Constitution.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Reed thought the Legislature ought not to be too much
      shackled. It would make the Constitution like Religious Creeds,
      embarrassing to those bound to conform to them &amp; more likely to
      produce dissatisfaction and scism, than harmony and union.

      M<sup>r</sup> Mason objected to M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge&#39;s motion, as

      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum. If the Convention who are comparatively so little
      biassed by local views are so much perplexed, How can it be expected that
      the Legislature hereafter under the full biass of those views, will be
      able to settle a standard. He was convinced by the arguments of others
      &amp; his own reflections, that the Convention ought to fix some standard
      or other.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris. The arg<sup>ts</sup> of others &amp;
      his own reflections had led him to a very different conclusion. If we can&#39;t
      agree on a rule that will be just at this time, how can we expect to find
      one that will be just in all times to come. Surely those who come after us
      will judge better of things present, than we can of things future. He
      could not persuade himself that numbers would be a just rule at any time.
      The remarks of (M<sup>r</sup> Mason) relative to the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page335" id="page335"></a>[pg&nbsp;335]</span> Western Country had
      not changed his opinion on that head. Among other objections it must be
      apparent they would not be able to furnish men equally enlightened, to
      share in the administration of our common interests. The Busy haunts of
      men not the remote wilderness, was the proper school of political Talents.
      If the Western people get the power into their hands they will ruin the
      Atlantic interests. The Back members are always most averse to the best
      measures. He mentioned the case of Pen<sup>a</sup> formerly. The lower
      part of the State had y<sup>e</sup> power in the first instance. They kept
      it in y<sup>r</sup> own hands &amp; the country was y<sup>e</sup> better
      for it. Another objection with him ag<sup>st</sup> admitting the blacks
      into the census, was that the people of Pen<sup>a</sup> would revolt at
      the idea of being put on a footing with slaves. They would reject any plan
      that was to have such an effect. Two objections had been raised ag<sup>st</sup>
      leaving the adjustment of the Representation from time, to time, to the
      discretion of the Legislature. The 1. was, they would be unwilling to
      revise it at all. The 2 that by referring to <i>wealth</i> they would be
      bound by a rule which if willing, they would be unable to execute. The 1<sup>st</sup>
      obj<sup>n</sup> distrusts their fidelity. But if their duty, their honor
      &amp; their oaths will not bind them, let us not put into their hands our
      liberty, and all our other great interests; let us have no Gov<sup>t</sup>
      at all. 2. If these ties will bind them, we need not distrust the
      practicability of the rule. It was followed in part by the Com<sup>e</sup>
      in the apportionment of Representatives yesterday reported to the House.
      The best course that could be taken would be to leave the interests of the
      people to the Representatives of the people.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison was not a little surprised to hear this implicit
      confidence urged by a member who on all occasions, had inculcated so
      strongly, the political depravity of men, and the necessity of checking
      one <span class="pagenum"><a name="page336" id="page336"></a>[pg&nbsp;336]</span>
      vice and interest by opposing to them another vice &amp; interest. If the
      Representatives of the people would be bound by the ties he had mentioned,
      what need was there of a Senate? What of a Revisionary power? But his
      reasoning was not only inconsistent with his former reasoning, but with
      itself. At the same time that he recommended this implicit confidence to
      the Southern States in the Northern majority, he was still more zealous in
      exhorting all to a jealousy of a Western Majority. To reconcile the gentl<sup>n</sup>
      with himself, it must be imagined that he determined the human character
      by the points of the compass. The truth was that all men having power
      ought to be distrusted to a certain degree. The case of Pen<sup>a</sup>
      had been mentioned where it was admitted that those who were possessed of
      the power in the original settlement, never admitted the new settlem<sup>ts</sup>
      to a due share of it. England was a still more striking example. The power
      there had long been in the hands of the boroughs, of the minority; who had
      opposed &amp; defeated every reform which had been attempted. Virg<sup>a</sup>
      was in a lesser degree another example. With regard to the Western States,
      he was clear &amp; firm in opinion, that no unfavorable distinctions were
      admissible either in point of justice or policy. He thought also that the
      hope of contributions to the Treas<sup>y</sup> from them had been much
      underrated. Future contributions it seemed to be understood on all hands
      would be principally levied on imports &amp; exports. The extent and
      fertility of the Western Soil would for a long time give to agriculture a
      preference over manufactures. Trials would be repeated till some articles
      could be raised from it that would bear a transportation to places where
      they could be exchanged for imported manufactures. Whenever the
      Mississippi should be opened to them, which would of necessity be y<sup>e</sup>
      case as soon as their <span class="pagenum"><a name="page337" id="page337"></a>[pg&nbsp;337]</span>
      population would subject them to any considerable share of the Public
      burden, imposts on their trade could be collected with less expence &amp;
      greater certainty, than on that of the Atlantic States. In the mean time,
      as their supplies must pass through the <i>Atlantic States</i>, their
      contributions would be levied in the same manner with those of the
      Atlantic States. He could not agree that any substantial objection lay ag<sup>st</sup>
      fix<sup>g</sup> numbers for the perpetual standard of Representation. It
      was said that Representation &amp; taxation were to go together; that
      taxation and wealth ought to go together, that population &amp; wealth
      were not measures of each other. He admitted that in different climates,
      under different forms of Gov<sup>t</sup> and in different stages of
      civilization the inference was perfectly just. He would admit that in no
      situation, numbers of inhabitants were an accurate measure of wealth. He
      contended however that in the U. States it was sufficiently so for the
      object in contemplation. Altho&#39; their climate varied considerably, yet
      as the Gov<sup>ts</sup> the laws, and the manners of all were nearly the
      same, and the intercourse between different parts perfectly free,
      population, industry, arts, and the value of labour, would constantly tend
      to equalize themselves. The value of labour might be considered as the
      principal criterion of wealth and ability to support taxes; and this would
      find its level in different places where the intercourse should be easy
      &amp; free, with as much certainty as the value of money or any other
      thing. Wherever labour would yield most, people would resort, till the
      competition should destroy the inequality. Hence it is that the people are
      constantly swarming from the more to the less populous places&mdash;from
      Europe to Am<sup>a</sup>&mdash;from the North<sup>n</sup> &amp; Middle
      parts of the U. S.&nbsp;to the Southern &amp; Western. They go where land
      is cheaper, because there labour is dearer. If it be true that the same
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page338" id="page338"></a>[pg&nbsp;338]</span>
      quantity of produce raised on the banks of the Ohio is of less value, than
      on the Delaware, it is also true that the same labor will raise twice or
      thrice, the quantity in the former, that it will raise in the latter
      situation.

      Col. Mason. Agreed with M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris that we ought
      to leave the interests of the people to the Representatives of the people;
      but the objection was that the Legislature would cease to be the
      Representatives of the people. It would continue so no longer than the
      States now containing a majority of the people should retain that
      majority. As soon as the Southern &amp; Western population should
      predominate, which must happen in a few years, the power w<sup>d</sup> be
      in the hands of the minority, and would never be yielded to the majority,

      these estimates with the respective numbers of people; and it had been
      found even including Boston, that the most exact proportion prevailed
      between numbers &amp; property. He was aware that there might be some
      weight in what had fallen from his colleague, as to the umbrage which
      might be taken by the people of the Eastern States. But he recollected
      that when the proposition of Cong<sup>s</sup> for changing the 8<sup>th</sup>

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson did not well see on what principle the admission of
      blacks in the proportion of three fifths could be explained. Are they
      admitted as Citizens? then why are they not admitted on an equality with
      White Citizens? are they admitted as property? then why is not other
      property admitted into the computation? These were difficulties however
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page340" id="page340"></a>[pg&nbsp;340]</span>
      which he thought must be overruled by the necessity of compromise. He had
      some apprehensions also from the tendency of the blending of the blacks
      with the whites, to give disgust to the people of Pen<sup>a</sup>, as had
      been intimated by his Colleague (M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris).
      But he differed from him in thinking numbers of inhab<sup>ts</sup> so
      incorrect a measure of wealth. He had seen the Western settlem<sup>ts</sup>
      of P<sup>a</sup> and on a comparison of them with the City of Philad<sup>a</sup>
      could discover little other difference, than that property was more
      unequally divided among individuals here than there. Taking the same

      Representation for their blacks. He was sure that N.&nbsp;Carol<sup>a</sup>
      would never confederate on any terms that did not rate them at least as
      3/5. If the Eastern States meant therefore to exclude them altogether the
      business was at an end.

    <p class="indent">
      D<sup>r</sup> Johnson, thought that wealth and population <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page343" id="page343"></a>[pg&nbsp;343]</span>
      were the true, equitable rule of representation; but he conceived that
      these two principles resolved themselves into one; population being the
      best measure of wealth. He concluded therefore that y<sup>e</sup> number
      of people ought to be established as the rule, and that all descriptions
      including blacks <i>equally</i> with the Whites, ought to fall within the
      computation. As various opinions had been expressed on the subject, he
      would move that a Committee might be appointed to take them into
      consideration and report thereon.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris. It has been said that it is high
      time to speak out, as one member, he would candidly do so. He came here to
      form a compact for the good of America. He was ready to do so with all the
      States. He hoped &amp; believed that all would enter into such a Compact.
      If they would not he was ready to join with any States that would. But as
      the Compact was to be voluntary, it is in vain for the Eastern States to
      insist on what the South<sup>n</sup> States will never agree to. It is
      equally vain for the latter to require what the other States can never
      admit; and he verily believed the people of Pen<sup>a</sup> will never
      agree to a representation of Negroes. What can be desired by these States
      more than has been already proposed; that the Legislature shall from time
      to time regulate Representation according to population &amp; wealth.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney desired that the rule of wealth should be
      ascertained and not left to the pleasure of the Legislature; and that
      property in slaves should not be exposed to danger under a Gov<sup>t</sup>
      instituted for the protection of property.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      The first clause in the Report of the first Grand Committee was postponed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth. In order to carry into effect the principle
      established, moved that to add to the last clause adopted by the House the
      words following, <span class="pagenum"><a name="page344" id="page344"></a>[pg&nbsp;344]</span>
      "and that the rule of contribution by direct taxation for the support of
      the Government of the U. States shall be the number of white inhabitants,
      and three fifths of every other description in the several States, until
      some other rule that shall more accurately ascertain the wealth of the
      several States can be devised and adopted by the Legislature."
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Butler seconded the motion in order that it might be
      committed.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph was not satisfied with the motion. The danger will
      be revived that the ingenuity of the Legislature may evade or pervert the
      rule so as to perpetuate the power where it shall be lodged in the first
      instance. He proposed in lieu of M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth&#39;s motion,
      "that in order to ascertain the alterations in Representation that may be
      required from time to time by changes in the relative circumstances of the
      States, a Census shall be taken within two years from the 1<sup>st</sup>
      meeting of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Legislature of the U.S.&nbsp;and once
      within the term of every &mdash;&mdash; year afterwards, of all the
      inhabitants in the manner &amp; according to the ratio recommended by
      Congress in their resolution of the 18<sup>th</sup> day of Ap<sup>l</sup>
      1783, (rating the blacks at 3/5 of their number) and that the Legislature
      of the U. S.&nbsp;shall arrange the Representation accordingly." He urged
      strenuously that express security ought to be provided for including
      slaves in the ratio of Representation. He lamented that such a species of
      property existed. But as it did exist the holders of it would require this
      security. It was perceived that the design was entertained by some of
      excluding slaves altogether; the Legislature therefore ought not to be
      left at liberty.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth withdraws his motion &amp; seconds that of M<sup>r</sup>
      Randolph.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson observed that less umbrage would perhaps be taken ag<sup>st</sup>
      an admission of the slaves into the Rule of representation, if it should
      be so expressed as <span class="pagenum"><a name="page345" id="page345"></a>[pg&nbsp;345]</span>
      to make them indirectly only an ingredient in the rule, by saying that
      they should enter into the rule of taxation; and as representation was to
      be according to taxation, the end would be equally attained. He
      accordingly moved &amp; was 2<sup>ded</sup> so to alter the last clause
      adopted by the House, that together with the amendment proposed the whole
      should read as follows&mdash;provided always that the representation ought
      to be proportioned according to direct taxation, and in order to ascertain
      the alterations in the direct taxation which may be required from time to
      time by the changes in the relative circumstances of the States, Resolved
      that a census be taken within two years from the first meeting of the
      Legislature of the U. States, and once within the term of every &mdash;&mdash;
      years afterwards of all the inhabitants of the U.S.&nbsp;in the manner and
      according to the ratio recommended by Congress in their Resolution of
      April 18. 1783; and that the Legislature of the U.S.&nbsp;shall proportion
      the direct taxation accordingly.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> King. Altho&#39; this amendment varies the aspect somewhat,
      he had still two powerful objections ag<sup>st</sup> tying down the
      Legislature to the rule of numbers. 1. they were at this time an uncertain
      index of the relative wealth of the States. 2. if they were a just index
      at this time it can not be supposed always to continue so. He was far from
      wishing to retain any unjust advantage whatever in one part of the
      Republic. If justice was not the basis of the connection it could not be
      of long duration. He must be shortsighted indeed who does not foresee that
      whenever the Southern States shall be more numerous than the Northern,
      they can &amp; will hold a language that will awe them into justice. If
      they threaten to separate now in case injury shall be done them, will
      their threats be less urgent or effectual, when force shall back their
      demands. Even in the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page346" id="page346"></a>[pg&nbsp;346]</span>
      intervening period, there will be no point of time at which they will not
      be able to say, do us justice or we will separate. He urged the necessity
      of placing confidence to a certain degree in every Gov<sup>t</sup> and did
      not conceive that the proposed confidence as to a periodical readjustment
      of the representation exceeded that degree.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney moved to amend M<sup>r</sup> Randolph&#39;s motion
      so as to make "blacks equal to the whites in the ratio of representation."
      This he urged was nothing more than justice. The blacks are the labourers,
      the peasants of the Southern States: they are as productive of pecuniary
      resources as those of the Northern States. They add equally to the wealth,
      and considering money as the sinew of war, to the strength of the nation.
      It will also be politic with regard to the Northern States, as taxation is
      to keep pace with Representation.

      taken of her absence. As she was still absent, and had no opportunity of
      deciding whether she would chuse to retain the number on the condition, of
      her being taxed in proportion to it, he thought the number ought to be
      reduced from three to two, before the question was taken on M<sup>r</sup>

      M<sup>r</sup> Read could not approve of the proposition. He had observed

      <i>N<sup>o</sup> of representatives</i>, the rule will be unjust, until an
      actual census shall be made. After that taxation may be precisely
      proportioned according to the principle established, to the <i>number of

      it will be made from another quarter. The rule will be as reasonable &amp;
      just before, as after a Census. As to fractional numbers, the Census will
      not destroy, but ascertain them. And they will have the same effect after
      as before the Census; for as he understands the rule, it is to be adjusted
      not to the number of <i>inhabitants</i>, but of <i>Representatives</i>.

      they ought to be added in their entire number, and not in the proportion
      of 3/5. If as property, the word wealth was right, and striking it out
      would produce the very inconsistency which it was meant to get rid of.&mdash;The
      train of business &amp; the late turn which it had taken, had led him he
      said, into deep meditation on it, and He w<sup>d</sup> candidly state the
      result. A distinction had been set up &amp; urged, between the N<sup>n</sup>
      and South<sup>n</sup> States. He had hitherto considered this doctrine as
      heretical. He still thought the distinction groundless. He sees however
      that it is persisted in, and the South<sup>n</sup> Gentlemen will not be
      satisfied unless they see the way open to their gaining a majority in the
      public Councils. The consequence of such a transfer of power from the
      maritime to the interior &amp; landed interest will he foresees be such an
      oppression of commerce that he shall be obliged to vote for y<sup>e</sup>
      vicious principle of equality in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch in order to
      provide some defence for the N.&nbsp;States ag<sup>st</sup> it. But to
      come more to the point; either this distinction is fictitious or real; if
      fictitious let it be dismissed &amp; let us proceed with due confidence.
      If it be real, instead of attempting to blend incompatible things, let us
      at once take a friendly leave of each other. There can be no end of
      demands for security if every particular interest is to be entitled to it.
      The Eastern States may claim it for their fishery, and for other objects,
      as the South<sup>n</sup> States claim it for their peculiar objects. In
      this struggle between the two ends of the Union, what part ought the
      middle States in point of policy to take: to join their Eastern brethren
      according to his ideas. If the South<sup>n</sup> States get the power into
      their hands, and be joined as they will be with the interior Country, they
      will inevitably bring on a war with Spain for the Mississippi. This
      language <span class="pagenum"><a name="page352" id="page352"></a>[pg&nbsp;352]</span>
      is already held. The interior Country having no property nor interest
      exposed on the sea, will be little affected by such a war. He wished to
      know what security the North<sup>n</sup> &amp; middle States will have ag<sup>st</sup>
      this danger. It has been said that N.&nbsp;C. S.&nbsp;C., and Georgia only
      will in a little time have a majority of the people of America. They must
      in that case include the great interior Country, and every thing was to be
      apprehended from their getting the power into their hands.

      that their negroes may not be taken from them, which some gentlemen within

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. If a general declaration would satisfy any gentleman
      he had no indisposition to declare his sentiments. Conceiving that all men
      wherever placed have equal rights and are equally entitled to confidence,
      he viewed without apprehension the period when a few States should contain
      the superior number of people. The majority of people wherever found ought
      in all questions to govern the minority. If the interior Country should
      acquire this majority, it will not only have the right, but will avail
      itself of it whether we will or no. This jealousy misled the policy of G.
      Britain with regard to America. The fatal maxims espoused by her were that
      the Colonies were growing too fast, and that their growth must be stinted
      in time. What were the consequences?, first, enmity on our part, then
      actual separation. Like consequences will result on the part of the
      interior settlements, if like jealousy &amp; policy be pursued on ours.
      Further, if numbers be not a proper <span class="pagenum"><a name="page353"
      id="page353"></a>[pg&nbsp;353]</span> rule, why is not some better rule
      pointed out. No one has yet ventured to attempt it. Cong<sup>s</sup> have
      never been able to discover a better. No State as far as he had heard, had
      suggested any other. In 1783, after elaborate discussion of a measure of
      wealth all were satisfied then as they are now that the rule of numbers,
      does not differ much from the combined rule of numbers &amp; wealth. Again
      he could not agree that property was the sole or primary object of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      &amp; society. The cultivation &amp; improvement of the human mind was the
      most noble object. With respect to this object, as well as to other <i>personal</i>
      rights, numbers were surely the natural &amp; precise measure of
      Representation. And with respect to property, they could not vary much
      from the precise measure. In no point of view however could the establishm<sup>t</sup>
      of numbers as the rule of representation in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch vary
      his opinion as to the impropriety of letting a vicious principle into the
      2<sup>d</sup> branch.&mdash;On the Question to strike out <i>Wealth</i>,
      &amp; to make the change as moved by M<sup>r</sup> Randolph, it passed in
      the affirmative.

      apprehended from Western States. He was for admitting them on liberal
      terms, but not for putting ourselves in their hands. They will if they
      acquire power like all men, abuse it. They will oppress commerce, and
      drain our wealth into the Western Country. To guard ag<sup>st</sup> these
      consequences, he thought it necessary to limit the number of new States to
      be admitted into the Union, in such a manner, that they should never be
      able to outnumber the Atlantic States. He accordingly moved "that in order
      to secure the liberties of the States already confederated, the number of
      Representatives in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch, of the States which shall
      hereafter be established, shall never exceed in number, the

      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge proposed to reconsider the two propositions
      touching the originating of money bills in the first &amp; the equality of
      votes in the second branch.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman was for the question on the whole at once. It was he
      said a conciliatory plan, it had been considered in all its parts, a great
      deal of time had been spent upon it, and if any part should now be
      altered, it would be necessary to go over the whole ground again.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> L. Martin urged the question on the whole. He did not like
      many parts of it. He did not like having two branches, nor the inequality
      of votes in the 1<sup>st</sup> branch. He was willing however to make
      trial of the plan, rather than do nothing.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson traced the progress of the report through its several
      stages, remarking y<sup>t</sup> when on the question concerning an
      equality of votes, the House was divided, our Constituents had they voted
      as their representatives did, would have stood as 2/3 ag<sup>st</sup> the
      equality, and 1/3 only in favor of it. This fact would ere long be known,
      and it will appear that this fundamental point has been carried by 1/3 ag<sup>st</sup>
      2/3. What hopes will our Constituents entertain when they find that the
      essential principles of justice have been violated in the outset of the
      Governm<sup>t</sup>. As to the privilege of originating money bills, it
      was not considered by any as of much moment, and by many as improper in
      itself. He hoped both clauses w<sup>d</sup> be reconsidered. The equality
      of votes was a point of such critical importance, that every opportunity
      ought to be allowed, for discussing and collecting the mind of the
      Convention upon it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> L. Martin denies that there were 2/3 ag<sup>st</sup> the
      equality of votes. The States that please to call themselves large, are
      the weakest in the Union. Look at Mas<sup>ts</sup>. Look at Virg<sup>a</sup>.
      Are they efficient States? <span class="pagenum"><a name="page356"
      id="page356"></a>[pg&nbsp;356]</span> He was for letting a separation take
      place if they desired it. He had rather there should be two Confederacies,
      than one founded on any other principle than an equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch at least.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson was not surprised that those who say that a minority
      is more than a majority should say the minority is stronger than the
      majority. He supposed the next assertion will be that they are richer
      also; though he hardly expected it would be persisted in when the States
      shall be called on for taxes &amp; troops.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry also animadverted on M<sup>r</sup> L. Martins remarks
      on the weakness of Mas<sup>ts</sup>. He favored the reconsideration with a
      view not of destroying the equality of votes; but of providing that the
      States should vote per Capita, which he said would prevent the delays
      &amp; inconveniences that had been experienced in Cong<sup>s</sup> and
      would give a national aspect &amp; Spirit to the management of business.
      He did not approve of a reconsideration of the clause relating to money
      bills. It was of great consequence. It was the corner stone of the
      accommodation. If any member of the Convention had the exclusive privilege
      of making propositions, would any one say that it would give him no
      advantage over other members. The Report was not altogether to his mind.
      But he would agree to it as it stood rather than throw it out altogether.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry said he should like the motion, but could see no hope
      of success. An accommodation must take place, and it was apparent from
      what had been seen that it could not do so on the ground of the motion. He
      was utterly against a partial confederacy, leaving other States to accede
      or not accede, as had been intimated.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> King said it was always with regret that he differed from
      his colleagues, but it was his duty to differ from (M<sup>r</sup> Gerry)
      on this occasion. He considered the proposed Government as substantially
      and formally, a General and National Government over the people of
      America. There never will be a case in which it will act as a federal
      Government on the States and not on the individual Citizens. And is it not
      a clear principle that in a free Gov<sup>t</sup> those who are to be the
      objects of a Gov<sup>t</sup> ought to influence the operations of it? What
      reason can be assigned why the same rule of representation s<sup>d</sup>
      not prevail in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch as in the 1<sup>st</sup>.? He
      could conceive none. On the contrary, every view of the subject that
      presented itself, seemed to require it. Two objections had been raised ag<sup>st</sup>
      it, drawn 1. from the terms of the existing compact. 2. from a supposed
      danger to the smaller States.&mdash;As to the first objection he thought
      it inapplicable. According to the existing Confederation, the rule by
      which the public burdens is to be <span class="pagenum"><a name="page358"
      id="page358"></a>[pg&nbsp;358]</span> apportioned is <i>fixed</i>, and
      must be pursued. In the proposed Govern<sup>t</sup> it cannot be fixed,
      because indirect taxation is to be substituted. The Legislature therefore
      will have full discretion to impose taxes in such modes &amp; proportions
      as they may judge expedient. As to the 2<sup>d</sup> objection, he thought
      it of as little weight. The Gen<sup>l</sup> Govern<sup>t</sup> can never
      wish to intrude on the State Govern<sup>ts</sup>. There could be no
      temptation. None had been pointed out. In order to prevent the
      interference of measures which seemed most likely to happen, he would have
      no objection to throwing all the State debts into the federal debt, making
      one aggregate debt of about 70,000,000 of dollars, and leaving it to be
      discharged by the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>. According to the idea
      of securing the State Gov<sup>ts</sup> there ought to be three distinct
      legislative branches. The 2<sup>d</sup> was admitted to be necessary, and
      was actually meant, to check the 1<sup>st</sup> branch, to give more
      wisdom, system, &amp; stability to the Gov<sup>t</sup> and ought clearly
      as it was to operate on the people, to be proportioned to them. For the
      third purpose of securing the States, there ought then to be a 3<sup>d</sup>
      branch, representing the States as such, and guarding by equal votes their
      rights &amp; dignities. He would not pretend to be as thoroughly
      acquainted with his immediate Constituents as his colleagues, but it was
      his firm belief that Mas<sup>ts</sup> would never be prevailed on to yield
      to an equality of votes. In N.&nbsp;York, (he was sorry to be obliged to
      say any thing relative to that State in the absence of its
      representatives, but the occasion required it), in N.&nbsp;York he had
      seen that the most powerful argument used by the considerate opponents to
      the grant of the Impost to Congress, was pointed ag<sup>st</sup> the
      vicious constitution of Cong<sup>s</sup> with regard to representation
      &amp; suffrage. He was sure that no Gov<sup>t</sup> could last that was
      not founded on just principles. He preferred the doing of nothing, to an
      allowance of an equal vote to all the States. It <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page359" id="page359"></a>[pg&nbsp;359]</span> would be better he
      thought to submit to a little more confusion &amp; convulsion, than to
      submit to such an evil. It was difficult to say what the views of
      different Gentlemen might be. Perhaps there might be some who thought no
      Governm<sup>t</sup> co-extensive with the U. States could be established
      with a hope of its answering the purpose. Perhaps there might be other
      fixed opinions incompatible with the object we are pursuing. If there
      were, he thought it but candid that Gentlemen should speak out that we
      might understand one another.

      M<sup>r</sup> Strong. The Convention had been much divided in opinion. In
      order to avoid the consequences of it, an accommodation had been proposed.
      A Committee had been appointed: and though some of the members of it were
      averse to an equality of votes, a Report had been made in favor of it. It
      is agreed on all hands that Congress are nearly at an end. If no
      Accommodation takes place, the Union itself must soon be dissolved. It has
      been suggested that if we cannot come to any general agreement, the
      principal States may form &amp; recommend a Scheme of Government. But will
      the small States in that case ever accede it. Is it probable that the
      large States themselves will under such circumstances embrace and ratify
      it. He thought the small States had made a considerable concession in the
      article of money bills, and that they might naturally expect some
      concessions on the other side. From this view of the matter he was
      compelled to give his vote for the Report taken altogether.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison expressed his apprehensions that if the proper
      foundation of Governm<sup>t</sup> was destroyed, by substituting an
      equality in place of a proportional Representation, no proper
      superstructure would be raised. If the small States really wish for a
      Government armed with the powers necessary to secure their liberties, and
      to enforce obedience on the larger <span class="pagenum"><a name="page360"
      id="page360"></a>[pg&nbsp;360]</span> members as well as themselves he
      could not help thinking them extremely mistaken in their means. He
      reminded them of the consequences of laying the existing Confederation on
      improper principles. All the principal parties to its compilation joined
      immediately in mutilating &amp; fettering the Governm<sup>t</sup> in such
      a manner that it has disappointed every hope placed in it. He appealed to
      the doctrine &amp; arguments used by themselves on a former occasion. It
      had been very properly observed by (M<sup>r</sup> Patterson) that
      Representation was an expedient by which the meeting of the people
      themselves was rendered unnecessary; And that the representatives ought
      therefore to bear a proportion to the votes which their constituents if
      convened would respectively have. Was not this remark as applicable to one
      branch of the Representation as to the other? But it had been said that
      the Govern<sup>t</sup> would in its operation be partly federal, partly
      national; that altho&#39; in the latter respect the Representatives of the
      people ought to be in proportion to the people; yet in the former it ought
      to be according to the number of States. If there was any solidity in this
      distinction he was ready to abide by it, if there was none it ought to be
      abandoned. In all cases where the Gen<sup>l</sup> Governm<sup>t</sup> is
      to act on the people, let the people be represented and the votes be
      proportional. In all cases where the Govern<sup>t</sup> is to act on the
      States as such in like manner as Cong<sup>s</sup> now acts on them, let
      the States be represented &amp; the votes be equal. This was the true
      ground of compromise if there was any ground at all. But he denied that
      there was any ground. He called for a single instance in which the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> was not to operate on the people individually. The
      practicability of making laws, with coercive sanctions, for the States as
      Political bodies, had been exploded on all hands. He observed that the
      people of the large States would in some way or <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page361" id="page361"></a>[pg&nbsp;361]</span> other secure to
      themselves a weight proportioned to the importance accruing from their
      superior numbers. If they could not effect it by a proportional
      representation in the Gov<sup>t</sup> they would probably accede to no Gov<sup>t</sup>
      which did not in a great measure depend for its efficacy on their
      voluntary cooperation; in which case they would indirectly secure their
      object. The existing confederacy proved that where the Acts of the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> were to be executed by the particular Gov<sup>ts</sup> the
      latter had a weight in proportion to their importance. No one would say
      that either in Cong<sup>s</sup> or out of Cong<sup>s</sup>. Delaware had
      equal weight with Pennsylv<sup>a</sup>. If the latter was to supply ten
      times as much money as the former, and no compulsion could be used, it was
      of ten times more importance, that she should voluntarily furnish the
      supply. In the Dutch confederacy the votes of the Provinces were equal.
      But Holland which supplies about half the money, governed the whole
      republic. He enumerated the objections ag<sup>st</sup> an equality of
      votes in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch, notwithstanding the proportional
      representation in the first. 1. the minority could negative the will of
      the majority of the people. 2. they could extort measures by making them a
      condition of their assent to other necessary measures. 3. they could
      obtrude measures on the majority by virtue of the peculiar powers which
      would be vested in the Senate. 4. the evil instead of being cured by time,
      would increase with every new State that should be admitted, as they must
      all be admitted on the principle of equality. 5. the perpetuity it would
      give to the preponderance of the North<sup>n</sup> ag<sup>st</sup> the
      South<sup>n</sup> Scale was a serious consideration. It seemed now to be
      pretty well understood that the real difference of interests lay, not
      between the large &amp; small but between the N.&nbsp;&amp; South<sup>n</sup>
      States. The institution of slavery &amp; its consequences formed the line
      of discrimination. There were 5 States on the South, 8 on <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page362" id="page362"></a>[pg&nbsp;362]</span>
      the North<sup>n</sup> side of this line. Should a proport<sup>l</sup>
      representation take place it was true, the N.&nbsp;side would still
      outnumber the other; but not in the same degree, at this time; and every
      day would tend towards an equilibrium.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson would add a few words only. If equality in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch was an error that time would correct, he should be less anxious to
      exclude it being sensible that perfection was unattainable in any plan;
      but being a fundamental and a perpetual error, it ought by all means to be
      avoided. A vice in the Representation, like an error in the first
      concoction, must be followed by disease, convulsions, and finally death
      itself. The justice of the general principle of proportional
      representation has not in argument at least been yet contradicted. But it
      is said that a departure from it so far as to give the States an equal
      vote in one branch of the Legislature is essential to their preservation.
      He had considered this position maturely, but could not see its
      application. That the States ought to be preserved he admitted. But does
      it follow that an equality of votes is necessary for the purpose? Is there
      any reason to suppose that if their preservation should depend more on the
      large than on the small States the security of the States ag<sup>st</sup>
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Government would be diminished? Are the large States
      less attached to their existence more likely to commit suicide, than the
      small? An equal vote then is not necessary as far as he can conceive: and
      is liable among other objections to this insuperable one: The great fault
      of the existing confederacy is its inactivity. It has never been a
      complaint ag<sup>st</sup> Cong<sup>s</sup> that they governed over much.
      The complaint has been that they have governed too little. To remedy this
      defect we were sent here. Shall we effect the cure by establishing an
      equality of votes as is proposed? no: this very equality carries us
      directly to Congress; to the <span class="pagenum"><a name="page363"
      id="page363"></a>[pg&nbsp;363]</span> system which it is our duty to
      rectify. The small States cannot indeed act, by virtue of this equality,
      but they may controul the Gov<sup>t</sup> as they have done in Cong<sup>s</sup>.
      This very measure is here prosecuted by a minority of the people of
      America. Is then the object of the Convention likely to be accomplished in
      this way? Will not our Constituents say? we sent you to form an efficient
      Gov<sup>t</sup> and you have given us one more complex indeed, but having
      all the weakness of the former govern<sup>t</sup>. He was anxious for
      uniting all the States under one Govern<sup>t</sup>. He knew there were
      some respectable men who preferred three confederacies, united by
      offensive &amp; defensive alliances. Many things may be plausibly said,
      some things may be justly said, in favor of such a project. He could not
      however concur in it himself; but he thought nothing so pernicious as bad
      first principles.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Elseworth asked two questions, one of M<sup>r</sup> Wilson,
      whether he had ever seen a good measure fail in Cong<sup>s</sup> for want
      of a majority of States in its favor? He had himself never known such an
      instance: the other of M<sup>r</sup> Madison whether a negative lodged
      with the majority of the States even the smallest, could be more dangerous
      than the qualified negative proposed to be lodged in a single Executive
      Magistrate, who must be taken from some one State?
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman, signified that his expectation was that the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Legislature would in some cases act on the <i>federal principle</i>, of
      requiring quotas. But he thought it ought to be empowered to carry their
      own plans into execution, if the States should fail to supply their
      respective quotas.

      extremely. All the powers given in the Report from the Com<sup>e</sup> of

      representation was to prevail in both branches of the Legislature. When he
      came here this morning his purpose was to have offered some propositions

      particularly might provide ag<sup>st</sup> the danger suspected on the

      come to any final decision with a bare majority on either side. For these

      M<sup>r</sup> Patterson, thought with M<sup>r</sup> R. that it was high
      time for the Convention to adjourn that the rule of secrecy ought to be
      rescinded, and that our Constituents should be consulted. No conciliation
      could be admissible on the part of the smaller States on any other ground
      than that of an equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch. If M<sup>r</sup>
      Randolph would reduce to form his motion for an adjournment sine die, he
      would second it with all his heart.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Gen<sup>l</sup> Pinkney wished to know of M<sup>r</sup> R. whether he
      meant an adjournment sine die, or only an adjournment for the day. If the
      former was meant, it differed <span class="pagenum"><a name="page368"
      id="page368"></a>[pg&nbsp;368]</span> much from his idea. He could not
      think of going to S.&nbsp;Carolina and returning again to this place.
      Besides it was chimerical to suppose that the States if consulted would
      ever accord separately, and beforehand.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph, had never entertained an idea of an adjournment
      sine die; &amp; was sorry that his meaning had been so readily &amp;
      strangely misinterpreted. He had in view merely an adjournment till
      to-morrow, in order that some conciliatory experiment might if possible be
      devised, and that in case the smaller States should continue to hold back,
      the larger might then take such measures, he would not say what, as might
      be necessary.

      M<sup>r</sup> Gerry observed that Mas<sup>ts</sup> was opposed to an
      adjournment, because they saw no new ground of compromise. But as it
      seemed to be the opinion of so many States that a trial sh<sup>d</sup> be
      made, the State would now concur in the adjournm<sup>t</sup>.

      On the morning following before the hour of the Convention a number of the
      members from the larger States, by common agreement met for the purpose of
      consulting on the proper steps to be taken in consequence of the vote in
      favor of an equal Representation in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch, and the
      apparent inflexibility of the smaller States on that point. Several
      members from the latter States also attended. The time was wasted in vague
      conversation on the subject, without any specific proposition or
      agreement. It appeared indeed that the opinions of the members who
      disliked the equality of votes differed much as to the importance of that
      point, and as to the policy of risking a failure of any general act of the
      Convention by inflexibly opposing it. Several of them supposing that no
      good Governm<sup>t</sup> could or would be built on that foundation, and
      that as a division of the convention into two opinions was unavoidable; it
      would be better that the side comprising the principal States, and a
      majority of the people of America, should propose a scheme of Gov<sup>t</sup>
      to the States, than that a scheme should be proposed on the other side,
      would have concurred in a firm opposition to the smaller States, and in a
      separate recommendation, if <span class="pagenum"><a name="page370"
      id="page370"></a>[pg&nbsp;370]</span> eventually necessary. Others seemed
      inclined to yield to the smaller States, and to concur in such an Act
      however imperfect &amp; exceptionable, as might be agreed on by the
      Convention as a body, tho&#39; decided by a bare majority of States and by
      a minority of the people of the U. States. It is probable that the result
      of this consultation satisfied the smaller States that they had nothing to
      apprehend from a Union of the larger, in any plan whatever ag<sup>st</sup>
      the equality of votes in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch.

      M<sup>r</sup> Govern<sup>r</sup> Morris, moved to reconsider the whole
      Resolution agreed to yesterday concerning the constitution of the 2
      branches of the Legislature. His object was to bring the House to a
      consideration in the abstract of the powers necessary to be vested in the
      general Government. It had been said, Let us know how the Gov<sup>t</sup>
      is to be modelled, and then we can determine what powers can be properly
      given to it. He thought the most eligible course was, first to determine
      on the necessary powers, and then so to modify the Govern<sup>t</sup> as
      that it might be justly &amp; properly enabled to administer them. He
      feared if we proceeded to a consideration of the powers, whilst the vote
      of yesterday including an equality of the States in the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch, remained in force, a reference to it, either mental or expressed,
      would mix itself with the merits of every question concerning the powers.&mdash;This
      motion was not seconded. (It was probably approved by several members who
      either despaired of success, or were apprehensive that the attempt would
      inflame the jealousies of the smaller States.)

      Resolution, and proposed in place of the words "individual legislation"
      line 4. inclusive, to insert "to make laws binding on the people of the
      United States in all cases which may concern the common interests of the
      Union; but not to interfere with the Government of the individual States
      in any matters of internal police which respect the Gov<sup>t</sup> of

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, considered the negative on the laws of the States
      as essential to the efficacy &amp; security of the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup>.
      The necessity of a general Gov<sup>t</sup> proceeds from the propensity of
      the States to pursue their particular interests in opposition to the
      general interest. This propensity will continue to disturb the system,
      unless effectually controuled. Nothing short of a negative on their laws
      will controul it. They will pass laws which will accomplish their
      injurious objects before they can be repealed by the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Legisl<sup>re</sup> or be set aside by the National Tribunals. Confidence
      can not be put in the State Tribunals as guardians of the National
      authority and interests. In all the States these are more or less depend<sup>t</sup>
      on the Legislatures. In Georgia they are appointed annually by the
      Legislature. In R. Island the Judges who refused to execute an
      unconstitutional law were displaced, and others substituted, by the
      Legislature who would be the willing instruments of the wicked &amp;
      arbitrary plans of their masters. A power of negativing the improper laws
      of the States is at once the most mild &amp; certain means of preserving
      the harmony of the system. Its utility is sufficiently displayed in the
      British system. Nothing could maintain the harmony &amp; subordination of
      the various parts of the empire, but the prerogative by which the Crown,
      stifles in the birth every Act of every part tending to discord or
      encroachment. It is true the prerogative is sometimes misapplied thro&#39;
      ignorance or a partiality to one particular part of y<sup>e</sup> empire;
      but we have not the same reason to fear such misapplications in our
      System. As to the sending <span class="pagenum"><a name="page374"

      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris was more &amp; more opposed to the

      never fail to prefer some man of distinguished character, or services;
      some man, if he might so speak, of continental reputation. If the

      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman thought that the sense of the Nation would be better
      expressed by the Legislature, than by the people at large. The latter will
      never be sufficiently informed of characters, and besides will never give
      a majority of votes to any one man. They will generally vote for some man
      in their own State, and the largest State will have the best chance for
      the appointment. If the choice be made by the Legisl<sup>re</sup> a
      majority of voices may be made necessary to constitute an election.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson. Two arguments have been urged ag<sup>st</sup> an
      election of the Executive Magistrate by the people. 1 the example of
      Poland where an Election of the supreme Magistrate is attended with the
      most dangerous commotions. The cases he observed were totally dissimilar.
      The Polish nobles have resources &amp; dependants which enable them to
      appear in force, and to threaten the Republic as well as each other. In
      the next place the electors all assemble in one place; which would not be
      the case with us. The 2<sup>d</sup> arg<sup>t</sup> is that a <i>majority</i>
      of the people would never concur. It might be answered that the
      concurrence of a majority of the people is not a necessary principle of
      election, nor required as such in any of the States. But allowing the
      objection all its force, it may be obviated by the expedient used in Mass<sup>ts</sup>,
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page376" id="page376"></a>[pg&nbsp;376]</span>
      where the Legislature by majority of voices, decide in case a majority of
      people do not concur in favor of one of the candidates. This would
      restrain the choice to a good nomination at least, and prevent in a great
      degree intrigue &amp; cabal. A particular objection with him ag<sup>st</sup>
      an absolute election by the Legisl<sup>re</sup> was that the Exec: in that
      case would be too dependent to stand the mediator between the intrigues
      &amp; sinister views of the Representatives and the general liberties
      &amp; interests of the people.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Pinkney did not expect this question would again have been
      brought forward: An Election by the people being liable to the most
      obvious &amp; striking objections. They will be led by a few active &amp;
      designing men. The most populous States by combining in favor of the same
      individual will be able to carry their points. The Nat<sup>l</sup>
      Legislature being most immediately interested in the laws made by
      themselves, will be most attentive to the choice of a fit man to carry
      them properly into execution.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris. It is said that in case of an
      election by the people the populous States will combine &amp; elect whom
      they please. Just the reverse. The people of such States cannot combine.
      If there be any combination it must be among their representatives in the
      Legislature. It is said the people will be led by a few designing men.
      This might happen in a small district. It can never happen throughout the
      continent. In the election of a Gov<sup>r</sup> of N.&nbsp;York, it
      sometimes is the case in particular spots, that the activity &amp;
      intrigues of little partizans are successful, but the general voice of the
      State is never influenced by such artifices. It is said the multitude will
      be uninformed. It is true they would be uninformed of what passed in the
      Legislative Conclave, if the election were to be made there; but they will
      not be uninformed of those great &amp; illustrious characters which have
      merited their esteem &amp; confidence. If the <span class="pagenum"><a
      name="page377" id="page377"></a>[pg&nbsp;377]</span> Executive be chosen
      by the Nat<sup>l</sup> Legislature, he will not be independent on it; and
      if not independent, usurpation &amp; tyranny on the part of the
      Legislature will be the consequence. This was the case in England in the
      last Century. It has been the case in Holland, where their Senates have
      engrossed all power. It has been the case every where. He was surprised
      that an election by the people at large should ever have been likened to
      the polish election of the first Magistrate. An election by the
      Legislature will bear a real likeness to the election by the Diet of
      Poland. The great must be the electors in both cases, and the corruption
      &amp; cabal w<sup>ch</sup> are known to characterize the one would soon
      find their way into the other. Appointments made by numerous bodies, are
      always worse than those made by single responsible individuals, or by the
      people at large.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Col. Mason. It is curious to remark the different language held at
      different times. At one moment we are told that the Legislature is
      entitled to thorough confidence, and to indefinite power. At another, that
      it will be governed by intrigue &amp; corruption, and cannot be trusted at
      all. But not to dwell on this inconsistency he would observe that a
      Government which is to last ought at least to be practicable. Would this
      be the case if the proposed election should be left to the people at
      large. He conceived it would be as unnatural to refer the choice of a
      proper character for Chief Magistrate to the people, as it would, to refer
      a trial of colours to a blind man. The extent of the Country renders it
      impossible that the people can have the requisite capacity to judge of the
      respective pretensions of the Candidates.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson, could not see the contrariety stated (by Col.
      Mason.) The Legisl<sup>re</sup> might deserve confidence in some respects,
      and distrust in others. In acts which were to affect them &amp; y<sup>r</sup>
      Constituents <span class="pagenum"><a name="page378" id="page378"></a>[pg&nbsp;378]</span>
      precisely alike confidence was due. In others jealousy was warranted. The
      appointment to great offices, where the Legisl<sup>re</sup> might feel
      many motives, not common to the public confidence was surely misplaced.
      This branch of business it was notorious, was the most corruptly managed
      of any that had been committed to legislative bodies.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Williamson, conceived that there was the same difference

      between an app<sup>t</sup> by lot, and by choice. There are at present
      distinguished characters, who are known perhaps to almost every man. This
      will not always be the case. The people will be sure to vote for some man
      in their own State, and the largest State will be sure to succeed. This
      will not be Virg<sup>a</sup> however. Her slaves will have no suffrage. As
      the Salary of the Executive will be fixed, and he will not be eligible a 2<sup>d</sup>

      Executive &amp; Judiciary departments in several respects. The latter
      executed the laws in certain cases as the former did in others. The former
      expounded &amp; applied them for certain purposes, as the latter did for
      others. The difference between them seemed to consist chiefly in two
      circumstances&mdash;1. the collective interest &amp; security were much
      more in the power <span class="pagenum"><a name="page381" id="page381"></a>[pg&nbsp;381]</span>
      belonging to the Executive than to the Judiciary department. 2. in the
      administration of the former much greater latitude is left to opinion and
      discretion than in the administration of the latter. But if the 2<sup>d</sup>
      consideration proves that it will be more difficult to establish a rule
      sufficiently precise for trying the Execut: than the Judges, &amp; forms
      an objection to the same tenure of office, both considerations prove that
      it might be more dangerous to suffer a Union between the Executive &amp;
      Legisl: powers, than between the Judiciary &amp; Legislative powers. He
      conceived it to be absolutely necessary to a well constituted Republic
      that the two first sh<sup>d</sup> be kept distinct &amp; independent of
      each other. Whether the plan proposed by the motion was a proper one was
      another question, as it depended on the practicability of instituting a
      tribunal for impeachm<sup>ts</sup> as certain &amp; as adequate in the one
      case as in the other. On the other hand, respect for the mover entitled
      his proposition to a fair hearing &amp; discussion, until a less
      objectionable expedient should be applied for guarding ag<sup>st</sup> a
      dangerous union of the Legislative &amp; Executive departments.

      Col. Mason. This motion was made some time ago &amp; negatived by a very
      large majority. He trusted that it w<sup>d</sup> be again negatived. It w<sup>d</sup>
      be impossible to define the misbehaviour in such a manner as to subject it
      to a proper trial; and perhaps still more impossible to compel so high an
      offender holding his office by such a tenure to submit to a trial. He
      considered an Executive during good behavior as a softer name only for an
      Executive for life. And that the next would be an easy step to hereditary
      Monarchy. If the motion should finally succeed, he might himself live to
      see such a Revolution. If he did not it was probable his children or grand
      children would. He trusted there were few men in that House who wished for
      it. No state he was sure had <span class="pagenum"><a name="page382"

      principles as to have the least bias in its favor.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison, was not apprehensive of being thought to favor any
      step towards monarchy. The real object with him was to prevent its
      introduction. Experience had proved a tendency in our governments to throw
      all power into the Legislative vortex. The Executives of the States are in
      general little more than Cyphers; the legislatures omnipotent. If no
      effectual check be devised for restraining the instability &amp;
      encroachments of the latter, a revolution of some kind or other would be
      inevitable. The preservation of Republican Gov<sup>t</sup> therefore
      required some expedient for the purpose, but required evidently at the
      same time that in devising it, the genuine principles of that form should
      be kept in view.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris was as little a friend to monarchy as
      any gentleman. He concurred in the opinion that the way to keep out
      monarchical Gov<sup>t</sup> was to establish such a Repub. Gov<sup>t</sup>
      as w<sup>d</sup> make the people happy and prevent a desire of change.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      Doc<sup>r</sup> McClurg was not so much afraid of the shadow of monarchy
      as to be unwilling to approach it; nor so wedded to Republican Gov<sup>t</sup>
      as not to be sensible of the tyrannies that had been &amp; may be
      exercised under that form. It was an essential object with him to make the
      Executive independent of the Legislature; and the only mode left for
      effecting it, after the vote destroying his ineligibility a second time,
      was to appoint him during good behavior.

      the motion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> L. Martin was strenuous for an app<sup>t</sup> by the 2<sup>d</sup>

      of characters &amp; most capable of making a fit choice.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman concurred in the observations of M<sup>r</sup>
      Martin, adding that the Judges ought to be diffused, which would be more
      likely to be attended to by the 2<sup>d</sup> branch, than by the
      Executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Mason. The mode of appointing the Judges may depend in some
      degree on the mode of trying impeachments of the Executive. If the Judges
      were to form a tribunal for that purpose, they surely ought not to be
      appointed by the Executive. There were insuperable objections besides ag<sup>st</sup>
      referring the appointment to the Executive. He mentioned as one, that as
      the Seat of Gov<sup>t</sup> must be in some one State, and as the
      Executive would remain in office for a considerable time, for 4. 5. or 6
      years at least, he would insensibly form local &amp; personal attachments
      <span class="pagenum"><a name="page385" id="page385"></a>[pg&nbsp;385]</span>
      within the particular State that would deprive equal merit elsewhere, of
      an equal chance of promotion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum. As the Executive will be responsible in point of
      character at least, for a judicious and faithful discharge of his trust,
      he will be careful to look through all the States for proper characters.
      The Senators will be as likely to form their attachments at the seat of
      Gov<sup>t</sup> where they reside, as the Executive. If they cannot get
      the man of the particular State to which they may respectively belong,
      they will be indifferent to the rest. Public bodies feel no personal
      responsibility, and give full play to intrigue &amp; cabal. Rh. Island is
      a full illustration of the insensibility to character produced by a
      participation of numbers in dishonorable measures, and of the length to
      which a Public body may carry wickedness &amp; cabal.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris supposed it would be improper for an
      impeachm<sup>t</sup> of the Executive to be tried before the Judges. The
      latter would in such case be drawn into intrigues with the Legislature and
      an impartial trial would be frustrated. As they w<sup>d</sup> be much
      about the Seat of Gov<sup>t</sup> they might even be previously consulted
      &amp; arrangements might be made for a prosecution of the Executive. He
      thought therefore that no argument could be drawn from the probability of
      such a plan of impeachments ag<sup>st</sup> the motion before the House.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison suggested that the Judges might be appointed by the
      Executive, with the concurrence of 1/3 at least, of the 2<sup>d</sup>
      branch. This would unite the advantage of responsibility in the Executive
      with the security afforded in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch ag<sup>st</sup> any
      incautious or corrupt nomination by the Executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Sherman, was clearly for an election by the Senate. It would
      be composed of men nearly equal to the Executive, and would of course have
      on the whole more wisdom. They would bring into their deliberations <span
      class="pagenum"><a name="page386" id="page386"></a>[pg&nbsp;386]</span> a
      more diffusive knowledge of characters. It would be less easy for
      candidates to intrigue with them, than with the Executive Magistrate. For
      these reasons he thought there would be a better security for a proper
      choice in the Senate than in the Executive.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph. It is true that when the app<sup>t</sup> of the
      Judges was vested in the 2<sup>d</sup> branch an equality of votes had not
      been given to it. Yet he had rather leave the appointm<sup>t</sup> there
      than give it to the Executive. He thought the advantage of personal
      responsibility might be gained in the Senate by requiring the respective
      votes of the members to be entered on the Journal. He thought too that the
      hope of receiving app<sup>ts</sup> would be more diffusive if they
      depended on the Senate, the members of which w<sup>d</sup> be diffusively
      known, than if they depended on a single man who could not be personally
      known to a very great extent; and consequently that opposition to the
      System, would be so far weakened.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Bedford thought there were solid reasons ag<sup>st</sup>
      leaving the appointment to the Executive. He must trust more to
      information than the Senate. It would put it in his power to gain over the
      larger States, by gratifying them with a preference of their Citizens. The
      responsibility of the Executive so much talked of was chimerical. He could
      not be punished for mistakes.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum remarked that the Senate could have no better
      information than the Executive. They must like him, trust to information
      from the members belonging to the particular State where the candidate
      resided. The Executive would certainly be more answerable for a good
      appointment, as the whole blame of a bad one would fall on him alone. He
      did not mean that he would be answerable under any other penalty than that
      of public censure, which with honorable minds was a sufficient one.

      M<sup>r</sup> Madison. The dependence will be less if the <i>increase
      alone</i> should be permitted, but it will be improper even so far to
      permit a dependence. Whenever an increase is wished by the Judges, or may
      be in agitation in the legislature, an undue complaisance in the former
      may be felt towards the latter. If at such a crisis there should be in
      Court suits to which leading members of the Legislature may be parties,
      the Judges will be in a situation which ought not to be suffered, if it
      can be prevented. The variations in the value of money, may be guarded ag<sup>st</sup>
      by taking for a standard wheat or some other thing of permanent value. The
      increase of business will be provided for by an increase of the number who
      are to do it. An increase of salaries may easily be so contrived as not to
      affect persons in office.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Gov<sup>r</sup> Morris. The value of money may not only
      alter but the State of Society may alter. In this event the same quantity
      of wheat, the same value would not be the same compensation. The Amount of
      salaries must always be regulated by the manners &amp; the style of living
      in a Country. The increase of business can not be provided for in the
      supreme tribunal in the way that has been mentioned. All the business of a
      certain description whether more or less must be done in that single
      tribunal. Additional labor alone in the Judges can provide for additional
      business. Additional compensation therefore ought not to be prohibited.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph observed that the Courts of the States can not be
      trusted with the administration of the National laws. The objects of
      jurisdiction are such as will often place the General &amp; local policy
      at variance.

      with safety to the general interest.

      become expedient to give effect to it whenever a certain number of States
      shall adopt it.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison the clause can mean nothing more than that provision

      Col. Mason. If the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> should have no right to
      suppress rebellions ag<sup>st</sup> particular States, it will be in a bad
      situation indeed. As Rebellions ag<sup>st</sup> itself originate in &amp;
      ag<sup>st</sup> individual States, it must remain a passive Spectator of
      its own subversion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph. The Resol<sup>n</sup> has 2. objects. 1. to secure
      a Republican Government. 2. to suppress domestic commotions. He urged the
      necessity of both these provisions.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison moved to substitute "that the Constitutional
      authority of the States shall be guaranteed to them respectively ag<sup>st</sup>
      domestic as well as foreign violence."

    <p class="indent">
      Doc<sup>r</sup> McClurg seconded the motion.

      M<sup>r</sup> Houston was afraid of perpetuating the existing
      Constitutions of the States. That of Georgia was a very bad one, and he
      hoped would be revised &amp; amended. It may also be difficult for the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup> to decide between contending parties each of which claim
      the sanction of the Constitution.

    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> L. Martin was for leaving the States to suppress Rebellions
      themselves.

      M<sup>r</sup> Ghorum thought it strange that a Rebellion should be known
      to exist in the Empire, and the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> sh<sup>d</sup>
      be restrained from interposing to subdue it. At this rate an enterprising
      Citizen might erect the standard of Monarchy in a particular State, might
      gather together partizans from all quarters, might extend his views from
      State to State, and threaten to establish a tyranny over the whole &amp;
      the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> be compelled to remain an inactive
      witness of its own destruction. With regard to different parties in a
      State; as long as they confine their disputes to words, they will be
      harmless to the Gen<sup>l</sup> Gov<sup>t</sup> &amp; to each other. If
      they appeal to the sword, it will then be necessary for the Gen<sup>l</sup>
      Gov<sup>t</sup>, however difficult it may be to decide on the merits of
      their contest, to interpose &amp; put an end to it.

      M<sup>r</sup> Carrol. Some such provision is essential. Every State ought
      to wish for it. It has been doubted whether it is a casus federis at the
      present. And no room ought to be left for such a doubt hereafter.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Randolph moved to add as an amend<sup>t</sup> to the motion;
      "and that no State be at liberty to form any other than a Republican Gov<sup>t</sup>."
      M<sup>r</sup> Madison seconded the motion.
    </p>
    <p class="indent">
      M<sup>r</sup> Rutlidge thought it unnecessary to insert any guarantee. No
      doubt could be entertained but that Cong<sup>s</sup> had the authority if
      they had the means to co-operate with any State in subduing a rebellion.
      It was &amp; would be involved in the nature of the thing.

      M<sup>r</sup> Wilson moved as a better expression of the idea, "that a

        This document was filled with errors and inconsistencies in punctuations
        and hyphenation. For example, usually the word re-eligible is
        hyphenated, but sometimes it is not; sometimes; reinstated is hyphenated
        but sometimes it is not; and usually the comma is used as a thousand
        mark, but sometimes a period is used for that purpose. Also, the
        abbreviations were not uniform (e.g., Mas. v. Mass.), which were only
        corrected when it was clear which abbreviation was considered correct at
        the time printed. Another example is the abbreviation for Resolution,
        which was sometimes Resol:<sup>n</sup>, sometimes Resol<sup>n</sup>, and
        sometimes Resol.<sup>n</sup>. Sometimes "nem: con." was used, and
        sometimes "nem. con." was used. The only time errors were corrected was
        when it was very clear that an error was made, and it was clear how the
        error should be corrected, and those corrections are listed below. One
        exception is the case where a period is missing at the end of a
        sentence, which happened so often that those corrections were made but
        were not listed below.
